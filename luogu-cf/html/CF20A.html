<h1>BerOS file system</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
给出一个电脑路径，连续的多个/可以被简化为一个/，且路径末的/可以省略，请输出简化后的最短的可能的路径。
输入输出格式
输入格式
第一行：仅包含小写字母和/的字符串，保证路径至少含有一个/，不超过100个字符
输出格式
第一行：一个字符串，表示简化后的路径</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The new operating system BerOS has a nice feature. It is possible to use any number of characters '/' as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional '/'. For example, strings //usr///local//nginx/sbin// and /usr/local/nginx///sbin are equivalent. The character '/' (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character '/'.
A path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters '/'.
Your task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains only lowercase Latin letters and character '/' — the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character '/'. The length of the given line is no more than 100 characters, it is not empty.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The path in normalized form.</div>
