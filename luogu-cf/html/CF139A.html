<h1>Petr and Book</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One Sunday Petr went to a bookshop and bought a new book on sports programming. The book had exactly $ n $ pages.
Petr decided to start reading it starting from the next day, that is, from Monday. Petr's got a very tight schedule and for each day of the week he knows how many pages he will be able to read on that day. Some days are so busy that Petr will have no time to read whatsoever. However, we know that he will be able to read at least one page a week.
Assuming that Petr will not skip days and will read as much as he can every day, determine on which day of the week he will read the last page of the book.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains the single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — the number of pages in the book.
The second line contains seven non-negative space-separated integers that do not exceed $ 1000 $ — those integers represent how many pages Petr can read on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday correspondingly. It is guaranteed that at least one of those numbers is larger than zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the number of the day of the week, when Petr will finish reading the book. The days of the week are numbered starting with one in the natural order: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>100

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Note to the first sample:
By the end of Monday and therefore, by the beginning of Tuesday Petr has 85 pages left. He has 65 pages left by Wednesday, 45 by Thursday, 30 by Friday, 20 by Saturday and on Saturday Petr finishes reading the book (and he also has time to read 10 pages of something else).
Note to the second sample:
On Monday of the first week Petr will read the first page. On Monday of the second week Petr will read the second page and will finish reading the book.</div>
