<h1>Choosing Symbol Pairs</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一个字符串，判断有多少对是相同的。包括自己和自己这一对。注意 $(x,y)$ 和 $(y,x)$ 是不相同的一对。
感谢@frankchenfu 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a given string $ S $ consisting of $ N $ symbols. Your task is to find the number of ordered pairs of integers $ i $ and $ j $ such that
1\. $ 1<=i,j<=N $
2\. $ S[i]=S[j] $ , that is the $ i $ -th symbol of string $ S $ is equal to the $ j $ -th.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single input line contains $ S $ , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It is guaranteed that string $ S $ in not empty and its length does not exceed $ 10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number which represents the number of pairs $ i $ and $ j $ with the needed property. Pairs $ (x,y) $ and $ (y,x) $ should be considered different, i.e. the ordered pairs count.</div>
