<h1>New Bus Route</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ cities situated along the main road of Berland. Cities are represented by their coordinates — integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . All coordinates are pairwise distinct.
It is possible to get from one city to another only by bus. But all buses and roads are very old, so the Minister of Transport decided to build a new bus route. The Minister doesn't want to spend large amounts of money — he wants to choose two cities in such a way that the distance between them is minimal possible. The distance between two cities is equal to the absolute value of the difference between their coordinates.
It is possible that there are multiple pairs of cities with minimal possible distance, so the Minister wants to know the quantity of such pairs.
Your task is to write a program that will calculate the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs which have this distance.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). All numbers $ a_{i} $ are pairwise distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integer numbers — the minimal distance and the quantity of pairs with this distance.</div>
