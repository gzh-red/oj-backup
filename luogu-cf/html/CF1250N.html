<h1>Wires</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>电路板上有 $10^9$个触点，有t组询问，每组询问会给你n条导线。你每次操作可以将第1-n任意一条导线的某端连到另一个触点处。问至少要操作多少次才能使所有导线连通，并给出任意一种合法方案
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarpus has a complex electronic device. The core of this device is a circuit board. The board has $ 10^9 $ contact points which are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 10^9 $ . Also there are $ n $ wires numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , each connecting two distinct contact points on the board. An electric signal can pass between wires $ A $ and $ B $ if:
- either both wires share the same contact point;
- or there is a sequence of wires starting with $ A $ and ending with $ B $ , and each pair of adjacent wires in the sequence share a contact point.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1250N/6e2b2c43d3bbdc24d7f958ca966b6424ae4f2ebd.png)The picture shows a circuit board with $ 5 $ wires. Contact points with numbers $ 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13 $ are used. Here an electrical signal can pass from wire $ 2 $ to wire $ 3 $ , but not to wire $ 1 $ .Currently the circuit board is broken. Polycarpus thinks that the board could be fixed if the wires were re-soldered so that a signal could pass between any pair of wires.
It takes $ 1 $ minute for Polycarpus to re-solder an end of a wire. I.e. it takes one minute to change one of the two contact points for a wire. Any contact point from range $ [1, 10^9] $ can be used as a new contact point. A wire's ends must always be soldered to distinct contact points. Both wire's ends can be re-solded, but that will require two actions and will take $ 2 $ minutes in total.
Find the minimum amount of time Polycarpus needs to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. Also output an optimal sequence of wire re-soldering.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains one or several test cases. The first input line contains a single integer $ t $ — number of test cases. Then, $ t $ test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of wires. The following $ n $ lines describe wires, each line containing two space-separated integers $ x_i, y_i $ ( $ 1 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9 $ , $ x_i \neq y_i $ ) — contact points connected by the $ i $ -th wire. A couple of contact points can be connected with more than one wire.
Sum of values of $ n $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case first print one line with a single integer $ k $ — the minimum number of minutes needed to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. In the following $ k $ lines print the description of re-solderings. Each re-soldering should be described by three integers $ w_j, a_j, b_j $ ( $ 1 \le w_j \le n $ , $ 1 \le a_j, b_j \le 10^9 $ ). Such triple means that during the $ j $ -th re-soldering an end of the $ w_j $ -th wire, which was soldered to contact point $ a_j $ , becomes soldered to contact point $ b_j $ instead. After each re-soldering of a wire it must connect two distinct contact points. If there are multiple optimal re-solderings, print any of them.</div>
