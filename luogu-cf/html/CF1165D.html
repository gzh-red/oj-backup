<h1>Almost All Divisors</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有t组数据
每组数据有一个n以及n个数，让你进行猜数，使得这个这n个数是你猜的数除1和本身以外的所有因子。
如果能猜到，输出最小的，否则输出-1.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We guessed some integer number $ x $ . You are given a list of almost all its divisors. Almost all means that there are all divisors except $ 1 $ and $ x $ in the list.
Your task is to find the minimum possible integer $ x $ that can be the guessed number, or say that the input data is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number.
You have to answer $ t $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 25 $ ) — the number of queries. Then $ t $ queries follow.
The first line of the query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 300 $ ) — the number of divisors in the list.
The second line of the query contains $ n $ integers $ d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n $ ( $ 2 \le d_i \le 10^6 $ ), where $ d_i $ is the $ i $ -th divisor of the guessed number. It is guaranteed that all values $ d_i $ are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print the answer to it.
If the input data in the query is contradictory and it is impossible to find such number $ x $ that the given list of divisors is the list of almost all its divisors, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum possible $ x $ .</div>
