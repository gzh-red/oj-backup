<h1>Pair Of Lines</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
在平面直角坐标系上给出$n$个点，求是否存在两条直线穿过所有点。
### 输入格式
第一行一个正整数$n(1 \leq n \leq 10^5)$表示点数，接下来$n$行每行两个整数$x_i , y_i(|x_i| , |y_i| \leq 10^9)$表示一个点。保证不存在两个点的$x_i,y_i$均相同。
### 输出格式
如果存在方案输出`YES`，否则输出`NO`。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ points on Cartesian plane. Every point is a lattice point (i. e. both of its coordinates are integers), and all points are distinct.
You may draw two straight lines (not necessarily distinct). Is it possible to do this in such a way that every point lies on at least one of these lines?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of points you are given.
Then $ n $ lines follow, each line containing two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ $ (|x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{9}) $ — coordinates of $ i $ -th point. All $ n $ points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is possible to draw two straight lines in such a way that each of given points belongs to at least one of these lines, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it is possible to draw two lines, the one containing the points $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 5 $ , and another one containing two remaining points.
