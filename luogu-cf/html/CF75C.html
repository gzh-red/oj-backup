找出a，b的最大公因子，然后给几个查询，每次查询包含x，y两个数字，查询在x~y之间的a，b的最大公因子

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Well, here is another math class task. In mathematics, GCD is the greatest common divisor, and it's an easy task to calculate the GCD between two positive integers.
A common divisor for two positive numbers is a number which both numbers are divisible by.
But your teacher wants to give you a harder task, in this task you have to find the greatest common divisor $ d $ between two integers $ a $ and $ b $ that is in a given range from $ low $ to $ high $ (inclusive), i.e. $ low<=d<=high $ . It is possible that there is no common divisor in the given range.
You will be given the two integers $ a $ and $ b $ , then $ n $ queries. Each query is a range from $ low $ to $ high $ and you have to answer each query.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ , the two integers as described above ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{9} $ ). The second line contains one integer $ n $ , the number of queries ( $ 1<=n<=10^{4} $ ). Then $ n $ lines follow, each line contains one query consisting of two integers, $ low $ and $ high $ ( $ 1<=low<=high<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ lines. The $ i $ -th of them should contain the result of the $ i $ -th query in the input. If there is no common divisor in the given range for any query, you should print -1 as a result for this query.</div>
