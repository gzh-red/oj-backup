<h1>Palindromic Magic</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.
Chouti has got two strings $ A $ and $ B $ . Since he likes [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome), he would like to pick $ a $ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $ A $ and $ b $ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $ B $ . Concatenating them, he will get string $ ab $ .
Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single string $ A $ ( $ 1 \le |A| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ).
The second line contains a single string $ B $ ( $ 1 \le |B| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ).
Strings $ A $ and $ B $ contain only lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line should contain a single integer — the number of possible strings.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>aa
aba
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>aaba
abaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>15
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, attainable strings are
- "a" + "a" = "aa",
- "aa" + "a" = "aaa",
- "aa" + "aba" = "aaaba",
- "aa" + "b" = "aab",
- "a" + "aba" = "aaba",
- "a" + "b" = "ab".
In the second example, attainable strings are "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaba", "aab", "aaba", "ab", "abaa", "abaaa", "abaaba", "abab", "ba", "baa", "baba", "bb".
Notice that though "a"+"aa"="aa"+"a"="aaa", "aaa" will only be counted once.</div>
