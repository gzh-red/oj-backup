<h1>Gotta Go Fast</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个游戏关卡有$n(n\le50)$个任务，若在$m$秒内按顺序完成所有任务则算作通过当前关卡。每个关卡有三个属性$a_i,b_i,p_i(1\le a_i<b_i\le100,80\le p_i\le99)$，表示有$p_i\%$的概率用$a_i$完成任务$i$，有$1-p_i\%$的概率用$b_i$秒完成任务$i$。每完成一个任务后可以选择继续下一个任务或重新开始当前关卡。问通过当前关卡的期望时间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You're trying to set the record on your favorite video game. The game consists of $ N $ levels, which must be completed sequentially in order to beat the game. You usually complete each level as fast as possible, but sometimes finish a level slower. Specifically, you will complete the $ i $ -th level in either $ F_{i} $ seconds or $ S_{i} $ seconds, where $ F_{i}&lt;S_{i} $ , and there's a $ P_{i} $ percent chance of completing it in $ F_{i} $ seconds. After completing a level, you may decide to either continue the game and play the next level, or reset the game and start again from the first level. Both the decision and the action are instant.
Your goal is to complete all the levels sequentially in at most $ R $ total seconds. You want to minimize the expected amount of time playing before achieving that goal. If you continue and reset optimally, how much total time can you expect to spend playing?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains integers $ N $ and $ R $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF865C/2edb953537ce7c8db1b280cf3e041068762c4830.png), the number of levels and number of seconds you want to complete the game in, respectively. $ N $ lines follow. The $ i $ th such line contains integers $ F_{i},S_{i},P_{i} $ $ (1<=F_{i}&lt;S_{i}<=100,80<=P_{i}<=99) $ , the fast time for level $ i $ , the slow time for level $ i $ , and the probability (as a percentage) of completing level $ i $ with the fast time.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the total expected time. Your answer must be correct within an absolute or relative error of $ 10^{-9} $ .
Formally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ . Your answer will be considered correct, if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF865C/cde5c1e0715ef65086b3065853dd22ee5a37eede.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, you never need to reset. There's an $ 81% $ chance of completing the level in $ 2 $ seconds and a $ 19% $ chance of needing $ 8 $ seconds, both of which are within the goal time. The expected time is $ 0.81·2+0.19·8=3.14 $ .
In the second example, you should reset after the first level if you complete it slowly. On average it will take $ 0.25 $ slow attempts before your first fast attempt. Then it doesn't matter whether you complete the second level fast or slow. The expected time is $ 0.25·30+20+0.85·3+0.15·9=31.4 $ .</div>
