<h1>Two Small Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你两个由'a','b','c'组成且长度为2的字符串$s,t.$
给定$n,$让你构造一个由$n$个'a',$n$个'b',$n$个'c'组成且长度为$3n$的字符串$res,$使得$s,t$不是$res$的子串$.$
若不可以$,$输出"NO"$,$否则$,$第一行输出"YES"$,$第二行输出任意一种符合条件的$res.$
数据范围$:1\leq n \leq10^5$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two strings $ s $ and $ t $ both of length $ 2 $ and both consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
Possible examples of strings $ s $ and $ t $ : "ab", "ca", "bb".
You have to find a string $ res $ consisting of $ 3n $ characters, $ n $ characters should be 'a', $ n $ characters should be 'b' and $ n $ characters should be 'c' and $ s $ and $ t $ should not occur in $ res $ as substrings.
A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, the strings "ab", "ac" and "cc" are substrings of the string "abacc", but the strings "bc", "aa" and "cb" are not substrings of the string "abacc".
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' in the resulting string.
The second line of the input contains one string $ s $ of length $ 2 $ consisting of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
The third line of the input contains one string $ t $ of length $ 2 $ consisting of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to find the suitable string, print "NO" on the first line.
Otherwise print "YES" on the first line and string $ res $ on the second line. $ res $ should consist of $ 3n $ characters, $ n $ characters should be 'a', $ n $ characters should be 'b' and $ n $ characters should be 'c' and $ s $ and $ t $ should not occur in $ res $ as substrings.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</div>
