<h1>Little Artem and Random Variable</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Artyom decided to study probability theory. He found a book with a lot of nice exercises and now wants you to help him with one of them.
Consider two dices. When thrown each dice shows some integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ inclusive. For each dice the probability of each outcome is given (of course, their sum is $ 1 $ ), and different dices may have different probability distributions.
We throw both dices simultaneously and then calculate values $ max(a,b) $ and $ min(a,b) $ , where $ a $ is equal to the outcome of the first dice, while $ b $ is equal to the outcome of the second dice. You don't know the probability distributions for particular values on each dice, but you know the probability distributions for $ max(a,b) $ and $ min(a,b) $ . That is, for each $ x $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ you know the probability that $ max(a,b) $ would be equal to $ x $ and the probability that $ min(a,b) $ would be equal to $ x $ . Find any valid probability distribution for values on the dices. It's guaranteed that the input data is consistent, that is, at least one solution exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of different values for both dices.
Second line contains an array consisting of $ n $ real values with up to 8 digits after the decimal point — probability distribution for $ max(a,b) $ , the $ i $ -th of these values equals to the probability that $ max(a,b)=i $ . It's guaranteed that the sum of these values for one dice is $ 1 $ . The third line contains the description of the distribution $ min(a,b) $ in the same format.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output two descriptions of the probability distribution for $ a $ on the first line and for $ b $ on the second line.
The answer will be considered correct if each value of max( $ a,b $ ) and min( $ a,b $ ) probability distribution values does not differ by more than $ 10^{-6} $ from ones given in input. Also, probabilities should be non-negative and their sums should differ from $ 1 $ by no more than $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
