<h1>Malek Dance Club</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给序列$0,1,2,...,2^n-1$都异或上x后,求逆序对数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As a tradition, every year before IOI all the members of Natalia Fan Club are invited to Malek Dance Club to have a fun night together. Malek Dance Club has $ 2^{n} $ members and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has $ 2^{n} $ members. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique id $ i $ from $ 0 $ to $ 2^{n}-1 $ . The same holds for each member of NFC.
One of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers $ (a,b) $ such that member $ a $ from MDC dances with member $ b $ from NFC.
The complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs $ (a,b) $ and $ (c,d) $ such that $ a&lt;c $ and $ b&gt;d $ .
You are given a binary number of length $ n $ named $ x $ . We know that member $ i $ from MDC dances with member ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF319A/99db469180d6ab11deff381b4df066112345cbb1.png) from NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .
Expression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF319A/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) denotes applying «XOR» to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in C++ and Java it denotes as «^», in Pascal — «xor».</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a binary number $ x $ of lenght $ n $ , $ (1<=n<=100) $ .
This number may contain leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the complexity of the given dance assignent modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
