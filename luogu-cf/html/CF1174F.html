<h1>Ehab and the Big Finale</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>这是一道交互题。
你有一棵$n$个节点的有根树，$1$号点是根节点。
这棵树中有一个隐藏的节点$x$，你需要通过询问把$x$找出来。
你可以进行如下两种询问：
1、$d$ $u$ $(1\le u\le n)$。交互库会返回节点$u$和$x$的距离。
2、$s$ $u$ $(1\le u\le n)$。交互库会返回从$u$到$x$的路径上第二个点的标号。注意，你询问的$u$必须是$x$的祖先，否则会Wrong Ans。
你需要在不超过$36$次询问之内找出$x$。$x$是预先设定好的，不会随着询问而改变。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is an interactive problem.
You're given a tree consisting of $ n $ nodes, rooted at node $ 1 $ . A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.
We chose a hidden node $ x $ . In order to find this node, you can ask queries of two types:
- d $ u $ ( $ 1 \le u \le n $ ). We will answer with the distance between nodes $ u $ and $ x $ . The distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.
- s $ u $ ( $ 1 \le u \le n $ ). We will answer with the second node on the path from $ u $ to $ x $ . However, there's a plot twist. If $ u $ is not an ancestor of $ x $ , you'll receive "Wrong answer" verdict!
Node $ a $ is called an ancestor of node $ b $ if $ a \ne b $ and the shortest path from node $ 1 $ to node $ b $ passes through node $ a $ . Note that in this problem a node is not an ancestor of itself.
Can you find $ x $ in no more than $ 36 $ queries? The hidden node is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \le u,v \le n $ ) that mean there's an edge between nodes $ u $ and $ v $ . It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>To print the answer, print "! x" (without quotes).
Interaction
To ask a question, print it in one of the formats above:
- d $ u $ ( $ 1 \le u \le n $ ), or
- s $ u $ ( $ 1 \le u \le n $ ).
After each question, you should read the answer: either the distance or the second vertex on the path, as mentioned in the legend.
If we answer with $ -1 $ instead of a valid answer, that means you exceeded the number of queries, made an invalid query, or violated the condition in the second type of queries. Exit immediately after receiving $ -1 $ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.
After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
- fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
- System.out.flush() in Java;
- flush(output) in Pascal;
- stdout.flush() in Python;
- See the documentation for other languages.
Hacks:
The first line should contain two integers $ n $ and $ x $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le x \le n $ ).
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines should contain two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \le u,v \le n $ ) that mean there is an edge between nodes $ u $ and $ v $ . The edges must form a tree.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the hidden node is node $ 5 $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1174F/2fc09cdc0e97e7f39493296632ab302b06fdb975.png)We first ask about the distance between node $ x $ and node $ 2 $ . The answer is $ 3 $ , so node $ x $ is either $ 4 $ or $ 5 $ . We then ask about the second node in the path from node $ 3 $ to node $ x $ . Note here that node $ 3 $ is an ancestor of node $ 5 $ . We receive node $ 5 $ as the answer. Finally, we report that the hidden node is node $ 5 $ .</div>
