<h1>Fire</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意: 某人的房子着火了,他想从大火中带走价值总和尽量多的物品,每次他只能带走一个,分别给出挽救某物品需要的时间t,该物品开始燃烧的时间d(在d时间开始燃烧就不能再挽救该物品了),该物品的价值p
读入: 第一行: 物品总数n(1<=n<=100)
以下n行,每行分别三个整数ti(1<=ti<=20),di(1<=di<=2000),pi(1<=pi<=20)
输出: 第一行: 能带走的最大的价值总和
第二行: 这些物品的数量
一行,数与数用空格分隔开,分别是能带走物品的编号(按读入顺序)

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp is in really serious trouble — his house is on fire! It's time to save the most valuable items. Polycarp estimated that it would take $ t_{i} $ seconds to save $ i $ -th item. In addition, for each item, he estimated the value of $ d_{i} $ — the moment after which the item $ i $ will be completely burned and will no longer be valuable for him at all. In particular, if $ t_{i}>=d_{i} $ , then $ i $ -th item cannot be saved.
Given the values $ p_{i} $ for each of the items, find a set of items that Polycarp can save such that the total value of this items is maximum possible. Polycarp saves the items one after another. For example, if he takes item $ a $ first, and then item $ b $ , then the item $ a $ will be saved in $ t_{a} $ seconds, and the item $ b $ — in $ t_{a}+t_{b} $ seconds after fire started.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of items in Polycarp's house.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains three integers $ t_{i},d_{i},p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=20 $ , $ 1<=d_{i}<=2000 $ , $ 1<=p_{i}<=20 $ ) — the time needed to save the item $ i $ , the time after which the item $ i $ will burn completely and the value of item $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the maximum possible total value of the set of saved items. In the second line print one integer $ m $ — the number of items in the desired set. In the third line print $ m $ distinct integers — numbers of the saved items in the order Polycarp saves them. Items are 1-indexed in the same order in which they appear in the input. If there are several answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Polycarp will have time to save any two items, but in order to maximize the total value of the saved items, he must save the second and the third item. For example, he can firstly save the third item in $ 3 $ seconds, and then save the second item in another $ 2 $ seconds. Thus, the total value of the saved items will be $ 6+5=11 $ .
In the second example Polycarp can save only the first item, since even if he immediately starts saving the second item, he can save it in $ 3 $ seconds, but this item will already be completely burned by this time.</div>
