<h1>Leaf Partition</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>yyb大神仙有一个$1$为根的有根树，设$L$是一个叶子节点的集合，$f(L)$就是这些集合的最小连通子图。
yyb大神仙要你给叶子分成若干个集合，使得任意$f(x)$和$f(y)$（$x,y$都是你分出来的集合），$f(x)\cap f(y)=\emptyset$。
yyb大神仙用神仙的力量0.00001ms算出了方案数。
于是yyb大神仙想让你也算一算。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rooted tree with $ n $ nodes, labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The tree is rooted at node $ 1 $ . The parent of the $ i $ -th node is $ p_i $ . A leaf is node with no children. For a given set of leaves $ L $ , let $ f(L) $ denote the smallest connected subgraph that contains all leaves $ L $ .
You would like to partition the leaves such that for any two different sets $ x, y $ of the partition, $ f(x) $ and $ f(y) $ are disjoint.
Count the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $ 998244353 $ . Two ways are different if there are two leaves such that they are in the same set in one way but in different sets in the other.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 200\,000 $ ) — the number of nodes in the tree.
The next line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \leq p_i < i $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the leaf nodes are $ 2,3,4,5 $ . The ways to partition the leaves are in the following image ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1146F/2d93c754688fbf52dd6de0ea5eb71d8810080c88.png)
In the second example, the only leaf is node $ 10 $ so there is only one partition. Note that node $ 1 $ is not a leaf.</div>
