<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We often go to supermarkets to buy some fruits or vegetables, and on the tag there prints the price for a kilo. But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that $ a $ yuan for $ b $ kilos (You don't need to care about what "yuan" is), the same as $ a/b $ yuan for a kilo.
Now imagine you'd like to buy $ m $ kilos of apples. You've asked $ n $ supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.
You can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.</div>

<div>The first line contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=5000 $ , $ 1<=m<=100 $ ), denoting that there are $ n $ supermarkets and you want to buy $ m $ kilos of apples.
The following $ n $ lines describe the information of the supermarkets. Each line contains two positive integers $ a,b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=100 $ ), denoting that in this supermarket, you are supposed to pay $ a $ yuan for $ b $ kilos of apples.</div>
