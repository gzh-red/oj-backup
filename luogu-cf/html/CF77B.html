<h1>Falling Anvils</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定实数$a, b(0\le a, b\le 10^6)$，求方程$x^2+\sqrt px +q$有至少一个实根的概率，其中$p\in [0, a], q\in [-b, b]$，$p, q$均是实数，在上述区间内等概率分布。
多组数据，$T\le 10000$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For some reason in many American cartoons anvils fall from time to time onto heroes' heads. Of course, safes, wardrobes, cruisers, planes fall sometimes too... But anvils do so most of all.
Anvils come in different sizes and shapes. Quite often they get the hero stuck deep in the ground. But have you ever thought who throws anvils from the sky? From what height? We are sure that such questions have never troubled you!
It turns out that throwing an anvil properly is not an easy task at all. Let's describe one of the most popular anvil throwing models.
Let the height $ p $ of the potential victim vary in the range $ [0;a] $ and the direction of the wind $ q $ vary in the range $ [-b;b] $ . $ p $ and $ q $ could be any real (floating) numbers. Then we can assume that the anvil will fit the toon's head perfectly only if the following equation has at least one real root:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF77B/aced119984763a9d9e5bf9bcf349dec6b5f37451.png)Determine the probability with which an aim can be successfully hit by an anvil.
You can assume that the $ p $ and $ q $ coefficients are chosen equiprobably and independently in their ranges.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=10000 $ ) — amount of testcases.
Each of the following $ t $ lines contain two space-separated integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 0<=a,b<=10^{6} $ ).
Pretests contain all the tests with $ 0&lt;a&lt;10,0<=b&lt;10 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ t $ lines — the probability of a successful anvil hit for each testcase. The absolute or relative error of the answer should not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
