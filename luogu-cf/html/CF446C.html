<h1>DZY Loves Fibonacci Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题面大意：给出一个数列，每次可以选取一个区间，按顺序加上第i个Fibonacci Numbers(斐波那契数)进行更新，也可以查询某一个区间的总和。
感谢@char32_t 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In mathematical terms, the sequence $ F_{n} $ of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation
$ F_{1}=1; F_{2}=1; F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} (n>2). $ DZY loves Fibonacci numbers very much. Today DZY gives you an array consisting of $ n $ integers: $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Moreover, there are $ m $ queries, each query has one of the two types:
1. Format of the query " $ 1\ l\ r $ ". In reply to the query, you need to add $ F_{i-l+1} $ to each element $ a_{i} $ , where $ l<=i<=r $ .
2. Format of the query " $ 2\ l\ r $ ". In reply to the query you should output the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF446C/9b1c73158dd7a4166f7d8fde16bb75f36899bc0e.png) modulo $ 1000000009 (10^{9}+9) $ .
Help DZY reply to all the queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=300000 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ — initial array $ a $ .
Then, $ m $ lines follow. A single line describes a single query in the format given in the statement. It is guaranteed that for each query inequality $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ holds.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of the second type, print the value of the sum on a single line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 4
1 2 3 4
1 1 4
2 1 4
1 2 4
2 1 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>17
12
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>After the first query, $ a=[2,3,5,7] $ .
For the second query, $ sum=2+3+5+7=17 $ .
After the third query, $ a=[2,4,6,9] $ .
For the fourth query, $ sum=2+4+6=12 $ .</div>
