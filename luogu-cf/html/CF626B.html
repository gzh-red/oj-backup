<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目
$Catherine$ 有一副$n$ 张牌，每一张牌要么是红的，要么是绿的，要么是蓝的。只要至少有两张牌，她就可以做两个动作之一：
* 取两张（不一定是相邻的）不同颜色的卡片，换成第三种颜色的新卡片；
* 取两张（不一定是相邻的）相同颜色的卡片，换成一张有这种颜色的新卡片。
她重复这个过程，直到只剩下一张卡片。最后一张卡可能有什么颜色？
## 输入
输入的第一行包含一个整数$n (1 \le n \le 200)$ 表示总的卡片数。
下一行包含一个长度为$n$ 的字符串$s$ 表示卡片的颜色。$s$ 只包含字符`B`、`G`和`R`，分别代表蓝色、绿色和红色。
## 输出
输出所有可能的颜色。按顺序输出。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Catherine has a deck of $ n $ cards, each of which is either red, green, or blue. As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions:
- take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;
- take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color.
She repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200 $ ) — the total number of cards.
The next line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ — the colors of the cards. $ s $ contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single string of up to three characters — the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Catherine has one red card and one blue card, which she must exchange for a green card.
In the second sample, Catherine has two green cards and one red card. She has two options: she can exchange the two green cards for a green card, then exchange the new green card and the red card for a blue card. Alternatively, she can exchange a green and a red card for a blue card, then exchange the blue card and remaining green card for a red card.
In the third sample, Catherine only has blue cards, so she can only exchange them for more blue cards.</div>
