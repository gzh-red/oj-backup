<h1>Buy One, Get One Free</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意：
你到一家正在进行特价活动的馅饼店买馅饼。规则是每全价购买一个馅饼，都可以免费得到一个价格较低的馅饼。
考虑到所有你想购买的馅饼的价格，给出你必须为所有馅饼支付的最小花费。
输入格式：
一个整数n(1<=n<=500000) 表示你希望获取的馅饼数
下面一行是n个整数，代表每个馅饼的价格，价格为正整数且不超过10^9‘。
输出格式：一个正整数表示最小花费。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A nearby pie shop is having a special sale. For each pie you pay full price for, you may select one pie of a strictly lesser value to get for free. Given the prices of all the pies you wish to acquire, determine the minimum total amount you must pay for all of the pies.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input will begin with an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=500000 $ ), the number of pies you wish to acquire. Following this is a line with $ n $ integers, each indicating the cost of a pie. All costs are positive integers not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum cost to acquire all the pies.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case you can pay for a pie with cost 5 and get a pie with cost 4 for free, then pay for a pie with cost 5 and get a pie with cost 3 for free, then pay for a pie with cost 4 and get a pie with cost 3 for free.
In the second test case you have to pay full price for every pie.</div>
