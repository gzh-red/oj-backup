<h1>Email from Polycarp</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一天，wqy从他同学那里收到了一封电子邮件。
然而他同学的电脑键盘坏了，如果他按下一个键$c$，屏幕上有可能会出现多个$c$字符。显然一个正常的键盘应该是按下一个键出现一个字符。
比如他同学想要打$\text{"hello"}$，那么屏幕上有可能会出现$\text{"hhhhhhhhello"}$,$\text{"heeeeeellllllllo"}$,$\text{"hhhhheelloooooooo"}$等等。但是按下一个键后屏幕上一定会出现至少一个字符，所以$\text{"hell"}$,$\text{"helo"}$这样的字符串是不可能出现的。
于是wqy开始猜测他同学的每一个单词可能会代表什么意思。然而他不确定是不是合法的，于是就来问你。
你会得到$T$组数据，每一组数据第一行是wqy猜的单词，第二行是邮件中出现的单词，你需要判断如果他同学依次按下了wqy猜的单词中的每一个字母，屏幕上有没有可能出现第二行中的单词。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Methodius received an email from his friend Polycarp. However, Polycarp's keyboard is broken, so pressing a key on it once may cause the corresponding symbol to appear more than once (if you press a key on a regular keyboard, it prints exactly one symbol).
For example, as a result of typing the word "hello", the following words could be printed: "hello", "hhhhello", "hheeeellllooo", but the following could not be printed: "hell", "helo", "hhllllooo".
Note, that when you press a key, the corresponding symbol must appear (possibly, more than once). The keyboard is broken in a random manner, it means that pressing the same key you can get the different number of letters in the result.
For each word in the letter, Methodius has guessed what word Polycarp actually wanted to write, but he is not sure about it, so he asks you to help him.
You are given a list of pairs of words. For each pair, determine if the second word could be printed by typing the first one on Polycarp's keyboard.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of pairs to check. Further input contains $ n $ descriptions of pairs.
The first line of each description contains a single non-empty word $ s $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line of the description contains a single non-empty word $ t $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The lengths of both strings are not greater than $ 10^6 $ .
It is guaranteed that the total length of all words $ s $ in the input is not greater than $ 10^6 $ . Also, it is guaranteed that the total length of all words $ t $ in the input is not greater than $ 10^6 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ lines. In the $ i $ -th line for the $ i $ -th pair of words $ s $ and $ t $ print YES if the word $ t $ could be printed by typing the word $ s $ . Otherwise, print NO.</div>
