<h1>Bark to Unlock</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
随着科技进步，制造商把解锁做的越来越人性化。去解锁手机，Arkady的宠物狗木木需要叫出密码。手机密码是一个长度为2的字符串。
木木的敌人，Kashtanka 想要解锁他的手机去偷取信息，但他只会叫n个词，每个长度都是2。他会一个接一个地喊出一定数量（可以相同）的词，如果密码是他喊出的词汇连接起的字符串的一个子串，就能成功解锁。告诉他能否成功解锁。
简明题意：
给你一个字符串和若干个字符串（长度均为2），若后者通过拼接（可以重复）使得前者是他的子串，就输出“YES”，不然输出“NO”。
输入格式：
第一行是一个长度为2的字符串，代表密码。
第二行是一个数n,代表Kashtanka会多少个单词。
接下来n行，每行一个长度为2的字符串，代表Kashtanka会的单词。
输出格式：
若可以成功输出YES，不然输出NO
感谢 @一个懵了的人 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As technologies develop, manufacturers are making the process of unlocking a phone as user-friendly as possible. To unlock its new phone, Arkady's pet dog Mu-mu has to bark the password once. The phone represents a password as a string of two lowercase English letters.
Mu-mu's enemy Kashtanka wants to unlock Mu-mu's phone to steal some sensible information, but it can only bark $ n $ distinct words, each of which can be represented as a string of two lowercase English letters. Kashtanka wants to bark several words (not necessarily distinct) one after another to pronounce a string containing the password as a substring. Tell if it's possible to unlock the phone in this way, or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two lowercase English letters — the password on the phone.
The second line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of words Kashtanka knows.
The next $ n $ lines contain two lowercase English letters each, representing the words Kashtanka knows. The words are guaranteed to be distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" if Kashtanka can bark several words in a line forming a string containing the password, and "NO" otherwise.
You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>ya

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>ah

ha

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the password is "ya", and Kashtanka can bark "oy" and then "ah", and then "ha" to form the string "oyahha" which contains the password. So, the answer is "YES".
In the second example Kashtanka can't produce a string containing password as a substring. Note that it can bark "ht" and then "tp" producing "http", but it doesn't contain the password "hp" as a substring.
In the third example the string "hahahaha" contains "ah" as a substring.</div>
