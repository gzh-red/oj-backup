<h1>Bachgold Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个整数$n$ （$2\leq n\leq 100000$ ），问最多能将其分解成多少质数的和。在第一行输出最多的质数数量$k$ ，下一行输出$k$ 个整数，为这些质数。
一个大于$1$ 的数如果只能被$1$ 和它自己整除，那它就是一个质数。
By @Khassar </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer $ n $ represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than $ 1 $ .
Recall that integer $ k $ is called prime if it is greater than $ 1 $ and has exactly two positive integer divisors — $ 1 $ and $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the output contains a single integer $ k $ — maximum possible number of primes in representation.
The second line should contain $ k $ primes with their sum equal to $ n $ . You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.</div>
