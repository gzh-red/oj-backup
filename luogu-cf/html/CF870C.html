<h1>Maximum splitting</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个正整数n，求最多能分成几个合数。
贡献者：我是一个菜鸡</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given several queries. In the $ i $ -th query you are given a single positive integer $ n_{i} $ . You are to represent $ n_{i} $ as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.
An integer greater than $ 1 $ is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to $ 1 $ and the integer itself.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of queries.
$ q $ lines follow. The ( $ i+1 $ )-th line contains single integer $ n_{i} $ ( $ 1<=n_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the $ i $ -th query.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands, or -1, if there are no such splittings.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div> $ 12=4+4+4=4+8=6+6=12 $ , but the first splitting has the maximum possible number of summands.
$ 8=4+4 $ , $ 6 $ can't be split into several composite summands.
$ 1,2,3 $ are less than any composite number, so they do not have valid splittings.</div>
