<h1>The Top Scorer</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小明在打比赛，包括小明自己一共有$p$名选手参赛，每个人的得分是一个非负整数。最后的冠军是得分最高的人，如果得分最高的人有多个，就等概率从这些人中选一个当冠军。
现在小明已知了自己的得分大于等于$r$，所有选手的得分和为$s$。求小明获胜的概率，结果对$998244353$取模。
$s,r \leq 5000,p \leq 100$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Hasan loves playing games and has recently discovered a game called TopScore. In this soccer-like game there are $ p $ players doing penalty shoot-outs. Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.
They have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.
According to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $ r $ and sum of the scores is $ s $ .
Thus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $ p $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_p $ ( $ 0 \le a_i $ ) — player's scores. Hasan is player number $ 1 $ , so $ a_1 \ge r $ . Also $ a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_p = s $ . Two states are considered different if there exists some position $ i $ such that the value of $ a_i $ differs in these states.
Once again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well). So he considers each of the final states to be equally probable to achieve.
Help Hasan find the probability of him winning.
It can be shown that it is in the form of $ \frac{P}{Q} $ where $ P $ and $ Q $ are non-negative integers and $ Q \ne 0 $ , $ P \le Q $ . Report the value of $ P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353} $ .</div>

<div>The only line contains three integers $ p $ , $ s $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \le p \le 100 $ , $ 0 \le r \le s \le 5000 $ ) — the number of players, the sum of scores of all players and Hasan's score, respectively.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Hasan can score $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ or $ 6 $ goals. If he scores $ 4 $ goals or more than he scores strictly more than his only opponent. If he scores $ 3 $ then his opponent also scores $ 3 $ and Hasan has a probability of $ \frac 1 2 $ to win the game. Thus, overall he has the probability of $ \frac 7 8 $ to win.
In the second example even Hasan's lower bound on goal implies him scoring more than any of his opponents. Thus, the resulting probability is $ 1 $ .</div>
