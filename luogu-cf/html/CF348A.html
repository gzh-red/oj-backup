<h1>Mafia</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$n$个人在玩游戏“黑手党”，这个游戏规则是每局必须有一个主持，$(n-1)$名选手。其中第$i$个人表示想玩$a_i$局游戏且不当主持，让求出满足每人要求的最少的局数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day $ n $ friends gathered together to play "Mafia". During each round of the game some player must be the supervisor and other $ n-1 $ people take part in the game. For each person we know in how many rounds he wants to be a player, not the supervisor: the $ i $ -th person wants to play $ a_{i} $ rounds. What is the minimum number of rounds of the "Mafia" game they need to play to let each person play at least as many rounds as they want?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=10^{5}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ — the $ i $ -th number in the list is the number of rounds the $ i $ -th person wants to play.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a single integer — the minimum number of game rounds the friends need to let the $ i $ -th person play at least $ a_{i} $ rounds.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>You don't need to know the rules of "Mafia" to solve this problem. If you're curious, it's a game Russia got from the Soviet times: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia\_(party\_game).</div>
