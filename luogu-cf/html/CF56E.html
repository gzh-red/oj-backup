<h1>Domino Principle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>#### 给你一些多米诺骨牌，在x轴上从左到右排列在一起，问，每一个倒向右边的时候会压倒多少个骨牌？给定的骨牌并不是按照x从小到大的顺序排列的。
----by qihongzhou2
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put $ n $ dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The $ i $ -th domino has the coordinate $ x_{i} $ and the height $ h_{i} $ . Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that.
Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate $ x $ and height $ h $ leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment $ [x+1,x+h-1] $ .

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow $ n $ lines containing two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ h_{i} $ ( $ -10^{8}<=x_{i}<=10^{8},2<=h_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ space-separated numbers $ z_{i} $ — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the $ i $ -th domino to the right (including the domino itself).</div>
