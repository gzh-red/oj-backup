<h1>Fourier Doodles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>从$21$到$50$的每个$i$，输出：
`((min(k,25)+k)mod(2+k%3) > 0)? 1: 0`。
每个数占一行。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem you have to solve a simple classification task: given an image, determine whether it depicts a Fourier doodle.
You are given a set of 50 images with ids 1 through 50. You are also given a text file labels.txt containing the labels for images with ids 1 through 20, which comprise the learning data set.
You have to output the classification results for images with ids 21 through 50 in the same format.</div>

<div>[Download the images and the training labels](http://tc-alchemy.progopedia.com/fourier-doodles.zip)
Each line of the file labels.txt contains a single integer 0 or 1. Line $ i $ (1-based) contains the label of the image {i}.png. Label 1 means that the image depicts a Fourier doodle, label 0 - that it does not.</div>
