<h1>Vanya and Triangles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求平面上n个点中三个点两两相连形成面积不为0的三角形的个数.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya got bored and he painted $ n $ distinct points on the plane. After that he connected all the points pairwise and saw that as a result many triangles were formed with vertices in the painted points. He asks you to count the number of the formed triangles with the non-zero area.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ ) — the number of the points painted on the plane.
Next $ n $ lines contain two integers each $ x_{i},y_{i} $ ( $ -100<=x_{i},y_{i}<=100 $ ) — the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point. It is guaranteed that no two given points coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print an integer — the number of triangles with the non-zero area among the painted points.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Note to the first sample test. There are $ 3 $ triangles formed: $ (0,0)-(1,1)-(2,0) $ ; $ (0,0)-(2,2)-(2,0) $ ; $ (1,1)-(2,2)-(2,0) $ .
Note to the second sample test. There is $ 1 $ triangle formed: $ (0,0)-(1,1)-(2,0) $ .
Note to the third sample test. A single point doesn't form a single triangle.</div>
