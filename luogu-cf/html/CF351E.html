<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ for his birthday.
Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ is a pair of indexes $ i,j $ $ (1<=i<j<=n) $ , such that an inequality $ a_{i}>a_{j} $ holds.
Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence $ p $ by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=2000) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers — sequence $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ p_{n} $ $ (|p_{i}|<=10^{5}) $ . The numbers are separated by spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.</div>
