<h1>Vanya and Computer Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Vanya 和他的朋友Vana正在玩一种电脑游戏，他们需要干掉n个怪物去过关，Vanya的角色每秒攻击x次，Vana的角色每秒攻击y次，而且每个角色抬起武器需要一次攻击的时间（也就是说Vanya第一次对怪物造成伤害是在1/x秒，且之后每1/x秒都会对怪物造成一次伤害），第i个怪物有a_i滴血，表示被攻击A_i次后就死了。
他们想知道对于每个怪物谁给了最后一击（如果同时给了最后一击，就认为他们都是最后一击）
输入
第一行n,x,y如题意
接下来n行,第i+1行表示a_i
输出
每个怪物输出一行是Vanya还是Vana给了最后一击，或者输出both表示他们都给了最后一击</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya and his friend Vova play a computer game where they need to destroy $ n $ monsters to pass a level. Vanya's character performs attack with frequency $ x $ hits per second and Vova's character performs attack with frequency $ y $ hits per second. Each character spends fixed time to raise a weapon and then he hits (the time to raise the weapon is $ 1/x $ seconds for the first character and $ 1/y $ seconds for the second one). The $ i $ -th monster dies after he receives $ a_{i} $ hits.
Vanya and Vova wonder who makes the last hit on each monster. If Vanya and Vova make the last hit at the same time, we assume that both of them have made the last hit.</div>
