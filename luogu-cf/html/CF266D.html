<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
BerDonalds是一家着名的快餐店，将在Bertown开设一家咖啡馆。重要的是选择新餐厅的位置，以便很容易到达那里。Bertown道路系统由代表 ñ n个连接点，由...连接 米 m双向道路。对于每条道路，我们知道它的长度。我们也知道，我们可以从任何交叉路口到达任何其他交叉路口，沿着道路行驶。
你的任务是找到餐厅的这个位置，从咖啡馆到最远路口的道路最短距离是最小的。请注意，餐厅不仅可以位于交叉路口，而且可以位于任何道路的任何地方。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>BerDonalds, a well-known fast food restaurant, is going to open a cafe in Bertown. The important thing is to choose the new restaurant's location so that it would be easy to get there. The Bertown road system is represented by $ n $ junctions, connected by $ m $ bidirectional roads. For each road we know its length. We also know that we can get from any junction to any other one, moving along the roads.
Your task is to find such location of the restaurant, that the shortest distance along the roads from the cafe to the farthest junction would be minimum. Note that the restaurant can be located not only on the junction, but at any point of any road.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF266D/561b437df3dc62263b6eb2527702a39f69ebdc07.png)) — the number of junctions and the number of roads, correspondingly. Then $ m $ lines follow, describing all Bertown roads. Each road is described by three integers $ a_{i},b_{i},w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}≠b_{i}; 1<=w_{i}<=10^{5} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are the numbers of the junctions, connected by the $ i $ -th road, and $ w_{i} $ is the length of the $ i $ -th road.
It is guaranteed that each road connects two distinct junctions, there is at most one road between any two junctions, and you can get from any junction to any other one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single real number — the shortest distance from the optimal restaurant location to the farthest junction. The answer will be considered correct, if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-9} $ .</div>
