<h1>Team Rocket Rises Again</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个n个点，m条边的带权无向图，和起点S。选择一个点u(u!=S)，使在图中删掉点u后，有尽可能多的点到s的最短距离改变。
输入
第一行三个整数n,m,s表示点数n，边数m和起点s.
随后的2~m+1行一行三个整数u,v,w描述从u到v边权为w的一条边
输出
一行一个整数表示删去点u后到s最短距离改变的点数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It's the turn of the year, so Bash wants to send presents to his friends. There are $ n $ cities in the Himalayan region and they are connected by $ m $ bidirectional roads. Bash is living in city $ s $ . Bash has exactly one friend in each of the other cities. Since Bash wants to surprise his friends, he decides to send a Pikachu to each of them. Since there may be some cities which are not reachable from Bash's city, he only sends a Pikachu to those friends who live in a city reachable from his own city. He also wants to send it to them as soon as possible.
He finds out the minimum time for each of his Pikachus to reach its destination city. Since he is a perfectionist, he informs all his friends with the time their gift will reach them. A Pikachu travels at a speed of $ 1 $ meters per second. His friends were excited to hear this and would be unhappy if their presents got delayed. Unfortunately Team Rocket is on the loose and they came to know of Bash's plan. They want to maximize the number of friends who are unhappy with Bash.
They do this by destroying exactly one of the other $ n-1 $ cities. This implies that the friend residing in that city dies, so he is unhappy as well.
Note that if a city is destroyed, all the roads directly connected to the city are also destroyed and the Pikachu may be forced to take a longer alternate route.
Please also note that only friends that are waiting for a gift count as unhappy, even if they die.
Since Bash is already a legend, can you help Team Rocket this time and find out the maximum number of Bash's friends who can be made unhappy by destroying exactly one city.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ s $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5} $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757F/a96c653ce18839af52c685b3a4dac28dbdbbdc23.png), $ 1<=s<=n $ ) — the number of cities and the number of roads in the Himalayan region and the city Bash lives in.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contain three space-separated integers $ u $ , $ v $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ , $ u≠v $ , $ 1<=w<=10^{9} $ ) denoting that there exists a road between city $ u $ and city $ v $ of length $ w $ meters.
It is guaranteed that no road connects a city to itself and there are no two roads that connect the same pair of cities.</div>
