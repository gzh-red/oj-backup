<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意**
读入n(1<=n<=1000000)
构造字符串s，p，使字符串s中， p 作为子序列出现的次数恰好等于n（本题采用SPJ）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Thanks to your help, Heidi is confident that no one can fool her. She has now decided to post some fake news on the HC $ ^{2} $ Facebook page. However, she wants to be able to communicate to the HC $ ^{2} $ committee that the post is fake, using some secret phrase hidden in the post as a subsequence. To make this method foolproof, she wants the phrase to appear $ n $ times in the post. She is asking you to design a post (string) $ s $ and a hidden phrase $ p $ such that $ p $ appears in $ s $ as a subsequence exactly $ n $ times.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should contain two nonempty strings $ s $ and $ p $ separated by a single space. Each string should be composed of letters (a-z and A-Z: both lowercase and uppercase are allowed) and have length at most $ 200 $ . The number of occurrences of $ p $ in $ s $ as a subsequence should be exactly $ n $ . If there are many possible solutions, output any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>An occurrence of $ p $ as a subsequence in $ s $ should be thought of as a set of positions in $ s $ such that the letters at these positions, in order, form $ p $ . The number of occurences is thus the number of such sets. For example, ab appears 6 times as a subsequence in aaabb, for the following sets of positions: $ {1,4},{1,5},{2,4},{2,5},{3,4},{3,5} $ (that is, we should choose one of the a's and one of the b's).</div>
