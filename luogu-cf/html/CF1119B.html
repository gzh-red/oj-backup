<h1>Alyona and a Narrow Fridge</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## **题目描述**
一个大小是$2\times h$的冰箱（就是$2$列$h$行），有$n$个瓶子，高度分别是$a_1,a_2,a_3...a_n$，要求把最多瓶子放进冰箱（不要求按顺序）。
瓶子只能放在架子上。可以有任意多个架子。架子不能把瓶子砍成两瓣。
## **输入输出格式**
### 输入格式：
第一行：$n(1\leq n\leq 10^3)$，$h(1\leq h\leq 10^9)$
第二行：$a_1,a_2,a_3...a_n(1\leq a_i\leq h)$
### 输出格式：
一行，一个数$k$，表示能把$a_1,a_2...a_k$放进冰箱

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alyona has recently bought a miniature fridge that can be represented as a matrix with $ h $ rows and $ 2 $ columns. Initially there is only one shelf at the bottom of the fridge, but Alyona can install arbitrary number of shelves inside the fridge between any two rows. A shelf is two cells wide, does not occupy any space but separates the inside of the fridge to the lower and upper part.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1119B/c98c592ce85da5f01ef96a9f1b1703b13a559a59.png)An example of a fridge with $ h = 7 $ and two shelves. The shelves are shown in black. The picture corresponds to the first example.Alyona has $ n $ bottles of milk that she wants to put in the fridge. The $ i $ -th bottle is $ a_i $ cells tall and $ 1 $ cell wide. She can put a bottle on some shelf if the corresponding space above the shelf is at least as tall as the bottle. She can not put a bottle on top of another bottle (if there is no shelf between them). Two bottles can not share a cell.
Alyona is interested in the largest integer $ k $ such that she can put bottles $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , ..., $ k $ in the fridge at the same time. Find this largest $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ h $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^3 $ , $ 1 \le h \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of bottles and the height of the fridge.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le h $ ) — the heights of the bottles.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single integer $ k $ — the maximum integer such that Alyona can put the bottles $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , ..., $ k $ in the fridge at the same time. If Alyona can put all bottles in the fridge, print $ n $ . It is easy to see that Alyona can always put at least one bottle in the fridge.</div>
