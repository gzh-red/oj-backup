<h1>Orchestra</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
管弦乐队由一个$cr\times c$的矩阵构成，每个演奏者占一个格子。其中有$n$个小提琴演奏者。
请问里面有多少个子矩阵，其中至少有$k$个小提琴演奏者。
第一行$4$个整数，$r,c,n,k( 1\le r,c,n\le 10,1\le k\le n)$。接下来$n$行，每行两个整数$x_i$和$y_i$ $(1\le x_i\le r,1\le y_i\le c)y_i$，表示该格子内有一个小提琴演奏者。
输入数据保证不会出现相同的坐标点。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Paul is at the orchestra. The string section is arranged in an $ r×c $ rectangular grid and is filled with violinists with the exception of $ n $ violists. Paul really likes violas, so he would like to take a picture including at least $ k $ of them. Paul can take a picture of any axis-parallel rectangle in the orchestra. Count the number of possible pictures that Paul can take.
Two pictures are considered to be different if the coordinates of corresponding rectangles are different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains four space-separated integers $ r $ , $ c $ , $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=r,c,n<=10 $ , $ 1<=k<=n $ ) — the number of rows and columns of the string section, the total number of violas, and the minimum number of violas Paul would like in his photograph, respectively.
The next $ n $ lines each contain two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=r $ , $ 1<=y_{i}<=c $ ): the position of the $ i $ -th viola. It is guaranteed that no location appears more than once in the input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of photographs Paul can take which include at least $ k $ violas.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>We will use '\*' to denote violinists and '\#' to denote violists.
In the first sample, the orchestra looks as follows
`<br></br>*#<br></br>**<br></br>` Paul can take a photograph of just the viola, the $ 1×2 $ column containing the viola, the $ 2×1 $ row containing the viola, or the entire string section, for $ 4 $ pictures total.In the second sample, the orchestra looks as follows
`<br></br>#*<br></br>*#<br></br>#*<br></br>` Paul must take a photograph of the entire section.In the third sample, the orchestra looks the same as in the second sample.</div>
