<h1>Mashmokh and Tokens</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bimokh is Mashmokh's boss. For the following $ n $ days he decided to pay to his workers in a new way. At the beginning of each day he will give each worker a certain amount of tokens. Then at the end of each day each worker can give some of his tokens back to get a certain amount of money. The worker can save the rest of tokens but he can't use it in any other day to get more money. If a worker gives back $ w $ tokens then he'll get ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF415B/20fbbc2f7cd05954124004c35a9f680362a3cd8c.png) dollars.
Mashmokh likes the tokens however he likes money more. That's why he wants to save as many tokens as possible so that the amount of money he gets is maximal possible each day. He has $ n $ numbers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ . Number $ x_{i} $ is the number of tokens given to each worker on the $ i $ -th day. Help him calculate for each of $ n $ days the number of tokens he can save.</div>
