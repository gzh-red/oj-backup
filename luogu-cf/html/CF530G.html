<h1>Levenshtein distance</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Levenshtein distance between two strings of letters is calculated as the minimal total cost of a sequence of edit actions that converts one of the strings into the other one. The allowed edit actions are:
- substitution: the cost of substituting one letter with another is equal to the difference of index numbers of these letters in English alphabet.
- insertion/deletion: the cost of inserting a letter into a string or deleting a letter from a string is equal to the index number of this letter in English alphabet (see examples).
You are given two strings. Find the Levenshtein distance between them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data consists of two lines, each line contains a string of lowercase Latin letters. Each string is between 1 and 100 letters long, inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the Levenshtein distance between the strings.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>arc
bug
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>8
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>dome
drone
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>19
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you should replace a with b (cost 1), r with u (cost 3) and c with g (cost 4).
In the second example you should insert r (cost 18) are replace m with n (cost 1).</div>
