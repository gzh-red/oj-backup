<h1>Chat</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are times you recall a good old friend and everything you've come through together. Luckily there are social networks — they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago.
More formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ where $ n $ is the total number of messages in the chat.
Each message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message $ x $ or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that $ k $ previous messages, message $ x $ and $ k $ next messages are visible (with respect to message $ x $ ). In case there are less than $ k $ messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.
Digging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message $ x $ (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.
Determine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number $ t $ for all $ t $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message $ x $ , the initial configuration is $ x $ itself, $ k $ previous and $ k $ next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=k<=n $ ) — the total amount of messages and the number of previous and next messages visible.
The second line features a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}&lt;i $ ), where $ a_{i} $ denotes the $ i $ -th message link destination or zero, if there's no link from $ i $ . All messages are listed in chronological order. It's guaranteed that the link from message $ x $ goes to message with number strictly less than $ x $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers with $ i $ -th denoting the number of distinct messages you can read starting from message $ i $ and traversing the links while possible.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider $ i=6 $ in sample case one. You will read message $ 6 $ , then $ 2 $ , then $ 1 $ and then there will be no link to go.
In the second sample case $ i=6 $ gives you messages $ 5,6,7 $ since $ k=1 $ , then $ 4,5,6 $ , then $ 2,3,4 $ and then the link sequence breaks. The number of distinct messages here is equal to $ 6 $ .</div>
