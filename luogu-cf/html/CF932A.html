<h1>Palindromic Supersequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
给定一个字符串$A$，要你找一个字符串$B$，保证它是一个回文字符串，且$A$是$B$的一个子序列。（例如给定一个字符串$ab$，会有一个满足条件的字符串$aabaa$，因为$aabaa$倒过来念还是$aabaa$，且$ab$是$aabaa$的一个子序列）
# 输入输出格式
## 输入
输入一个字符串$A$（$1$≤|$A$|≤$10^3$），其中|$A$|是字符串的长度。
## 输出
输出一个满足条件的字符串$B$，保证$B$的长度最多不超过$10^4$。
## 样例输入1
aba
## 样例输出1
aba
## 样例输入2
ab
## 样例输出2
aabaa
# 提示与说明
## 1.
本题不需要找到满足条件的所有字符串$B$当中最小的一个，只需输出一解即可。
## 2.
保证有解。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ A $ . Find a string $ B $ , where $ B $ is a palindrome and $ A $ is a subsequence of $ B $ .
A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest".
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward.
The length of string $ B $ should be at most $ 10^{4} $ . It is guaranteed that there always exists such string.
You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string $ B $ should not exceed $ 10^{4} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains a string $ A $ ( $ 1<=|A|<=10^{3} $ ) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where $ |A| $ is a length of $ A $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output single line containing $ B $ consisting of only lowercase Latin letters. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string $ B $ should not exceed $ 10^{4} $ . If there are many possible $ B $ , print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" which is a palindrome.
In the second example, "ab" is a subsequence of "aabaa" which is a palindrome.</div>
