<h1>Modular Exponentiation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定n,m，求$m\ mod\ 2^n$
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The following problem is well-known: given integers $ n $ and $ m $ , calculate
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF913A/73fb55a49ff8c4211b34696969c8aef5090c1d6d.png), where $ 2^{n}=2·2·...·2 $ ( $ n $ factors), and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF913A/b0d2851c9c5ab36f8f15a3eac416cac07be09dd3.png) denotes the remainder of division of $ x $ by $ y $ .
You are asked to solve the "reverse" problem. Given integers $ n $ and $ m $ , calculate

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{8} $ ).
The second line contains a single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=10^{8} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF913A/d4dceae314a5c8428af0d75bf92415449f36c7d5.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the remainder of division of 42 by $ 2^{4}=16 $ is equal to 10.
In the second example, 58 is divisible by $ 2^{1}=2 $ without remainder, and the answer is 0.</div>
