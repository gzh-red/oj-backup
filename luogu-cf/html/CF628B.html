<h1>New Skateboard</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Problem
给定一个只包含数字的字符串S，请计算有多少个子串能够被4整除，对于一个子串允许有前导0。
比如，字符串124能够被4整除的子串有：12,4,24,124；
字符串04能够被4整除的子串有：0,4,04。
Input Data
第一行，一个字符串S，长度不超过3×10^​5​​ ，只包含数字字符。
Output Data
一行，一个整数，表示能被4整除的子串的数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Max wants to buy a new skateboard. He has calculated the amount of money that is needed to buy a new skateboard. He left a calculator on the floor and went to ask some money from his parents. Meanwhile his little brother Yusuf came and started to press the keys randomly. Unfortunately Max has forgotten the number which he had calculated. The only thing he knows is that the number is divisible by $ 4 $ .
You are given a string $ s $ consisting of digits (the number on the display of the calculator after Yusuf randomly pressed the keys). Your task is to find the number of substrings which are divisible by $ 4 $ . A substring can start with a zero.
A substring of a string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters.
For example if string $ s $ is 124 then we have four substrings that are divisible by $ 4 $ : 12, 4, 24 and 124. For the string 04 the answer is three: 0, 4, 04.
As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=3·10^{5} $ ). The string $ s $ contains only digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print integer $ a $ — the number of substrings of the string $ s $ that are divisible by $ 4 $ .
Note that the answer can be huge, so you should use $ 64 $ -bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.</div>
