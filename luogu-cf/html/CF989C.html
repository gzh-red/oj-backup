<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> As the boat drifts down the river, a wood full of blossoms shows up on the riverfront."I've been here once," Mino exclaims with delight, "it's breathtakingly amazing."
"What is it like?"
"Look, Kanno, you've got your paintbrush, and I've got my words. Have a try, shall we?"
There are four kinds of flowers in the wood, Amaranths, Begonias, Centaureas and Dianthuses.
The wood can be represented by a rectangular grid of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. In each cell of the grid, there is exactly one type of flowers.
According to Mino, the numbers of connected components formed by each kind of flowers are $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ and $ d $ respectively. Two cells are considered in the same connected component if and only if a path exists between them that moves between cells sharing common edges and passes only through cells containing the same flowers.
You are to help Kanno depict such a grid of flowers, with $ n $ and $ m $ arbitrarily chosen under the constraints given below. It can be shown that at least one solution exists under the constraints of this problem.
Note that you can choose arbitrary $ n $ and $ m $ under the constraints below, they are not given in the input.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ and $ d $ ( $ 1 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 100 $ ) — the required number of connected components of Amaranths, Begonias, Centaureas and Dianthuses, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, output two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \leq n, m \leq 50 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid respectively.
Then output $ n $ lines each consisting of $ m $ consecutive English letters, representing one row of the grid. Each letter should be among 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', representing Amaranths, Begonias, Centaureas and Dianthuses, respectively.
In case there are multiple solutions, print any. You can output each letter in either case (upper or lower).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, each cell of Amaranths, Begonias and Centaureas forms a connected component, while all the Dianthuses form one.
