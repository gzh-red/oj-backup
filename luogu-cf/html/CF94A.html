<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Igor K. always used to trust his favorite Kashpirovsky Antivirus. That is why he didn't hesitate to download the link one of his groupmates sent him via QIP Infinium. The link was said to contain "some real funny stuff about swine influenza". The antivirus had no objections and Igor K. run the flash application he had downloaded. Immediately his QIP Infinium said: "invalid login/password".
Igor K. entered the ISQ from his additional account and looked at the info of his main one. His name and surname changed to "H1N1" and "Infected" correspondingly, and the "Additional Information" field contained a strange-looking binary code $ 80 $ characters in length, consisting of zeroes and ones. "I've been hacked" — thought Igor K. and run the Internet Exploiter browser to quickly type his favourite search engine's address.
Soon he learned that it really was a virus that changed ISQ users' passwords. Fortunately, he soon found out that the binary code was actually the encrypted password where each group of $ 10 $ characters stood for one decimal digit. Accordingly, the original password consisted of $ 8 $ decimal digits.
Help Igor K. restore his ISQ account by the encrypted password and encryption specification.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data contains $ 11 $ lines. The first line represents the binary code $ 80 $ characters in length. That is the code written in Igor K.'s ISQ account's info. Next $ 10 $ lines contain pairwise distinct binary codes $ 10 $ characters in length, corresponding to numbers 0, 1, ..., 9.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one line containing $ 8 $ characters — The password to Igor K.'s ISQ account. It is guaranteed that the solution exists.</div>
