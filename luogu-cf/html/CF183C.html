<h1>Cyclic Coloring</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a directed graph $ G $ with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ arcs (multiple arcs and self-loops are allowed). You have to paint each vertex of the graph into one of the $ k $ $ (k<=n) $ colors in such way that for all arcs of the graph leading from a vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ , vertex $ v $ is painted with the next color of the color used to paint vertex $ u $ .
The colors are numbered cyclically $ 1 $ through $ k $ . This means that for each color $ i $ $ (i&lt;k) $ its next color is color $ i+1 $ . In addition, the next color of color $ k $ is color $ 1 $ . Note, that if $ k=1 $ , then the next color for color $ 1 $ is again color $ 1 $ .
Your task is to find and print the largest possible value of $ k $ $ (k<=n) $ such that it's possible to color $ G $ as described above with $ k $ colors. Note that you don't necessarily use all the $ k $ colors (that is, for each color $ i $ there does not necessarily exist a vertex that is colored with color $ i $ ).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{5} $ ), denoting the number of vertices and the number of arcs of the given digraph, respectively.
Then $ m $ lines follow, each line will contain two space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ), which means that the $ i $ -th arc goes from vertex $ a_{i} $ to vertex $ b_{i} $ .
Multiple arcs and self-loops are allowed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of the colors that can be used to paint the digraph (i.e. $ k $ , as described in the problem statement). Note that the desired value of $ k $ must satisfy the inequality $ 1<=k<=n $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first example, with $ k=2 $ , this picture depicts the two colors (arrows denote the next color of that color).
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF183C/5fc25b3e1baecb0cc286fd1a3b08fbd0e1f5c4eb.png)With $ k=2 $ a possible way to paint the graph is as follows.

For the second example, here's the picture of the $ k=5 $ colors.
