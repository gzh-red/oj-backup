<h1>Extraordinarily Nice Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The positive integer $ a $ is a divisor of the positive integer $ b $ if and only if there exists a positive integer $ c $ such that $ a×c=b $ .
King Astyages thinks a positive integer $ x $ is extraordinarily nice if the number of its even divisors is equal to the number of its odd divisors.
For example $ 3 $ has two positive divisors $ 3 $ and $ 1 $ , both of which are odd, so $ 3 $ is not extraordinarily nice. On the other hand $ 2 $ is only divisible by $ 2 $ and $ 1 $ , so it has one odd and one even divisor. Therefore $ 2 $ is extraordinarily nice.
Given a positive integer $ x $ determine whether it's extraordinarily nice.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains only a single integer $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=10^{3} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Write a single yes or no. Write yes if the number is extraordinarily nice and no otherwise.
You don't need to care about capital or small letters. The output is case-insensitive.</div>
