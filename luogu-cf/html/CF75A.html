<h1>Life Without Zeros</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>标题：没有0的人生
背景： 你能想象没有0的生活吗？毫无疑问我们会遇到很多问题。
描述： 给你a和b，令c=a+b,询问去掉0后的a和b相加是否等于去掉0后的c。
例如：
若两个数为101和102,101+102=203，去掉0后11+12=23，仍然成立。
若两个数为105和106,105+106=211，去掉0后15+16=31≠211，不成立。
输入： 输入有两行，每行各有一个无前导0的数ai。1≤ai≤1e9。
输出： 输出就一行，如果仍然保持相等则输出"YES"（无引号），否则输出"NO"。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Can you imagine our life if we removed all zeros from it? For sure we will have many problems.
In this problem we will have a simple example if we removed all zeros from our life, it's the addition operation. Let's assume you are given this equation $ a+b=c $ , where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, and $ c $ is the sum of $ a $ and $ b $ . Now let's remove all zeros from this equation. Will the equation remain correct after removing all zeros?
For example if the equation is $ 101+102=203 $ , if we removed all zeros it will be $ 11+12=23 $ which is still a correct equation.
But if the equation is $ 105+106=211 $ , if we removed all zeros it will be $ 15+16=211 $ which is not a correct equation.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input will consist of two lines, the first line will contain the integer $ a $ , and the second line will contain the integer $ b $ which are in the equation as described above ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{9} $ ). There won't be any leading zeros in both. The value of $ c $ should be calculated as $ c=a+b $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output will be just one line, you should print "YES" if the equation will remain correct after removing all zeros, and print "NO" otherwise.</div>
