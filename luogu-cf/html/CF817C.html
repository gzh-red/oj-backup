<h1>Really Big Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>统计从1到n中有几个数减去其各数位之和后大于s</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan likes to learn different things about numbers, but he is especially interested in really big numbers. Ivan thinks that a positive integer number $ x $ is really big if the difference between $ x $ and the sum of its digits (in decimal representation) is not less than $ s $ . To prove that these numbers may have different special properties, he wants to know how rare (or not rare) they are — in fact, he needs to calculate the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than $ n $ .
Ivan tried to do the calculations himself, but soon realized that it's too difficult for him. So he asked you to help him in calculations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first (and the only) line contains two integers $ n $ and $ s $ ( $ 1<=n,s<=10^{18} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the quantity of really big numbers that are not greater than $ n $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example numbers $ 10 $ , $ 11 $ and $ 12 $ are really big.
In the second example there are no really big numbers that are not greater than $ 25 $ (in fact, the first really big number is $ 30 $ : $ 30-3>=20 $ ).
In the third example $ 10 $ is the only really big number ( $ 10-1>=9 $ ).</div>
