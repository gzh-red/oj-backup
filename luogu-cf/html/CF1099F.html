<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$Mitya$和$Vasya$正在玩一个有趣的游戏 。
他们有一颗有根树，根节点的标号为1.对于标号为$i$的节点$(i≥2)$,他的父节点为$p_i$。
每个节点上有一些饼干，节点$i$上有$x_i$个饼干，$Mitya$在节点$i$上每吃一块饼干需要$t_i$时间。
对于标号为$i$的节点$(i≥2)$,通过连接他的父节点和他自己的路径需要花费$l_i$时间。
$Mitya$和$Vasya$轮流进行游戏，$Mitya$先走。
在进行游戏的过程中，有以下两点规则：
- $Mitya$每次可以从当前点走到自己的任意一个儿子节点
- $Vasya$每次可以在所有的连接$Mitya$所在点与其所在点的儿子的路径中选择一条，并移除它。每一回合，$Vasya$都可以选择不删除任意一条路径。
$Mitya$可以在任意一个他的回合停止游戏。停止游戏后，他会沿着先前走过的路径回到根节点，并在沿路中吃掉一些饼干。
$Mitya$吃饼干，从根节点到别的节点以及从别的节点返回到根节点的总时间不能超过$T$。
问：$Mitya$最多能吃多少饼干。
**注意：$Mitya$和$Vasya$都是绝顶聪明的**
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mitya and Vasya are playing an interesting game. They have a rooted tree with $ n $ vertices, and the vertices are indexed from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The root has index $ 1 $ . Every other vertex $ i \ge 2 $ has its parent $ p_i $ , and vertex $ i $ is called a child of vertex $ p_i $ .
There are some cookies in every vertex of the tree: there are $ x_i $ cookies in vertex $ i $ . It takes exactly $ t_i $ time for Mitya to eat one cookie in vertex $ i $ . There is also a chip, which is initially located in the root of the tree, and it takes $ l_i $ time to move the chip along the edge connecting vertex $ i $ with its parent.
Mitya and Vasya take turns playing, Mitya goes first.
- Mitya moves the chip from the vertex, where the chip is located, to one of its children.
- Vasya can remove an edge from the vertex, where the chip is located, to one of its children. Vasya can also decide to skip his turn.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1099F/c069bff2519a847888dff57e46c42c7e5083106c.png)Mitya can stop the game at any his turn. Once he stops the game, he moves the chip up to the root, eating some cookies along his way. Mitya can decide how many cookies he would like to eat in every vertex on his way. The total time spent on descend, ascend and eating cookies should not exceed $ T $ . Please note that in the end of the game the chip is always located in the root of the tree: Mitya can not leave the chip in any other vertex, even if he has already eaten enough cookies — he must move the chip back to the root (and every move from vertex $ v $ to its parent takes $ l_v $ time).
Find out what is the maximum number of cookies Mitya can eat, regardless of Vasya's actions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ T $ — the number of vertices in the tree and the time he has to accomplish his task ( $ 2\le n \le 10^5 $ ; $ 1\le T\le10^{18} $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_1 $ , $ x_2 $ , ..., $ x_n $ — number of cookies located in the corresponding vertex ( $ 1\le x_i\le10^6 $ ). The third line contains $ n $ integers $ t_1 $ , $ t_2 $ , ..., $ t_n $ — how much time it takes Mitya to eat one cookie in vertex $ i $ ( $ 1\le t_i\le10^6 $ ).
Each of the following $ n - 1 $ lines describe the tree. For every $ i $ from $ 2 $ to $ n $ , the corresponding line contains two integers $ p_i $ and $ l_i $ , where $ p_i $ denotes the parent of vertex $ i $ and $ l_i $ denotes the time it takes Mitya to move the chip along the edge from vertex $ i $ to its parent ( $ 1\le p_i < i $ , $ 0\le l_i \le 10^9 $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example test case, Mitya can start by moving the chip to vertex $ 2 $ . In this case no matter how Vasya plays, Mitya is able to eat at least $ 11 $ cookies. Below you can find the detailed description of the moves:
1. Mitya moves chip to vertex $ 2 $ .
2. Vasya removes edge to vertex $ 4 $ .
3. Mitya moves chip to vertex $ 5 $ .
4. Since vertex $ 5 $ has no children, Vasya does not remove any edges.
5. Mitya stops the game and moves the chip towards the root, eating cookies along the way ( $ 7 $ in vertex $ 5 $ , $ 3 $ in vertex $ 2 $ , $ 1 $ in vertex $ 1 $ ).
Mitya spend $ 1+0 $ time to go down, $ 0+1 $ to go up, $ 7\cdot 2 $ to eat $ 7 $ cookies in vertex 5, $ 3\cdot 3 $ to eat $ 3 $ cookies in vertex 2, $ 1\cdot 1 $ to eat $ 1 $ cookie in vertex 1. Total time is $ 1+0+0+1+7\cdot 2+3\cdot 3+1\cdot 1=26 $ .</div>
