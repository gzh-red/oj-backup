<h1>Ostap and Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>问对一棵树染色,初始无色,要求距每个点最近的染色点的距离不超过k的染色方法总和</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ostap already settled down in Rio de Janiero suburb and started to grow a tree in his garden. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected acyclic graph.
Ostap's tree now has $ n $ vertices. He wants to paint some vertices of the tree black such that from any vertex $ u $ there is at least one black vertex $ v $ at distance no more than $ k $ . Distance between two vertices of the tree is the minimum possible number of edges of the path between them.
As this number of ways to paint the tree can be large, Ostap wants you to compute it modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . Two ways to paint the tree are considered different if there exists a vertex that is painted black in one way and is not painted in the other one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 0<=k<=min(20,n-1) $ ) — the number of vertices in Ostap's tree and the maximum allowed distance to the nearest black vertex. Don't miss the unusual constraint for $ k $ .
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contain two integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) — indices of vertices, connected by the $ i $ -th edge. It's guaranteed that given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the remainder of division of the number of ways to paint the tree by $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Ostap has to paint both vertices black.
In the second sample, it is enough to paint only one of two vertices, thus the answer is $ 3 $ : Ostap can paint only vertex $ 1 $ , only vertex $ 2 $ , vertices $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ both.
In the third sample, the valid ways to paint vertices are: $ {1,3} $ , $ {1,4} $ , $ {2,3} $ , $ {2,4} $ , $ {1,2,3} $ , $ {1,2,4} $ , $ {1,3,4} $ , $ {2,3,4} $ , $ {1,2,3,4} $ .</div>
