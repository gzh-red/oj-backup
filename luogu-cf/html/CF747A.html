<h1>Display Size</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个高端大气上档次的公司决定推出一款新系列的矩形显示器。并且他们规定：这个矩形显示器必须有n个像素。
现在，他们交给你一个任务：确定矩形显示器的显示大小。
当然，他们还有一些条件：
第一，显示器上必须正好有n个像素；
第二，每一行的像素个数a不能超过每一列的像素个数b，
即a<=b;
第三，你必须让b-a的差尽可能小。
输入：
一个自然数n（1<=n<=1e6）
输出：
a和b</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A big company decided to launch a new series of rectangular displays, and decided that the display must have exactly $ n $ pixels.
Your task is to determine the size of the rectangular display — the number of lines (rows) of pixels $ a $ and the number of columns of pixels $ b $ , so that:
- there are exactly $ n $ pixels on the display;
- the number of rows does not exceed the number of columns, it means $ a<=b $ ;
- the difference $ b-a $ is as small as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the positive integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ) — the number of pixels display should have.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers — the number of rows and columns on the display.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>8
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>64
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>8 8
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>1 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>999999
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>999 1001
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the minimum possible difference equals 2, so on the display should be 2 rows of 4 pixels.
In the second example the minimum possible difference equals 0, so on the display should be 8 rows of 8 pixels.
In the third example the minimum possible difference equals 4, so on the display should be 1 row of 5 pixels.</div>
