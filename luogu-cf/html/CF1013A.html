<h1>Piles With Stones</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.
Its most beautiful place is the $ n $ piles with stones numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
EJOI participants have visited this place twice.
When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $ , correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook.
They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $ y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n $ . One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.
It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $ 108 $ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.
Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains a single integer $ n $ , the number of piles with stones in the garden ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 50 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers separated by spaces $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $ , the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ( $ 0 \leq x_i \leq 1000 $ ).
The third line contains $ n $ integers separated by spaces $ y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n $ , the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ( $ 0 \leq y_i \leq 1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.
In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.
It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.</div>
