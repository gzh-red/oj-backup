<h1>Restoration of string</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A substring of some string is called the most frequent, if the number of its occurrences is not less than number of occurrences of any other substring.
You are given a set of strings. A string (not necessarily from this set) is called good if all elements of the set are the most frequent substrings of this string. Restore the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several such strings exist, restore lexicographically minimum string. If there are no good strings, print "NO" (without quotes).
A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of letters in the string. For example, "ab", "c", "abc" are substrings of string "abc", while "ac" is not a substring of that string.
The number of occurrences of a substring in a string is the number of starting positions in the string where the substring occurs. These occurrences could overlap.
String $ a $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ b $ , if $ a $ is a prefix of $ b $ , or $ a $ has a smaller letter at the first position where $ a $ and $ b $ differ.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of strings in the set.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the strings are distinct.
The total length of the strings doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the non-empty good string with minimum length. If several good strings exist, print lexicographically minimum among them. Print "NO" (without quotes) if there are no good strings.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>One can show that in the first sample only two good strings with minimum length exist: "cfmailru" and "mailrucf". The first string is lexicographically minimum.</div>
