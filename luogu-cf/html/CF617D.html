<h1>Polyline</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are three points marked on the coordinate plane. The goal is to make a simple polyline, without self-intersections and self-touches, such that it passes through all these points. Also, the polyline must consist of only segments parallel to the coordinate axes. You are to find the minimum number of segments this polyline may consist of.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each of the three lines of the input contains two integers. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the minimum possible number of segments of the polyline.</div>
