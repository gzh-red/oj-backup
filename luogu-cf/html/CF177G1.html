<h1>Fibonacci Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fibonacci strings are defined as follows:
- $ f_{1} $ = «a»
- $ f_{2} $ = «b»
- $ f_{n} $ = $ f_{n-1} f_{n-2} $ , $ n>2 $
Thus, the first five Fibonacci strings are: "a", "b", "ba", "bab", "babba".
You are given a Fibonacci string and $ m $ strings $ s_{i} $ . For each string $ s_{i} $ , find the number of times it occurs in the given Fibonacci string as a substring.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ k $ and $ m $ — the number of a Fibonacci string and the number of queries, correspondingly.
Next $ m $ lines contain strings $ s_{i} $ that correspond to the queries. It is guaranteed that strings $ s_{i} $ aren't empty and consist only of characters "a" and "b".
The input limitations for getting 30 points are:
- $ 1<=k<=3000 $
- $ 1<=m<=3000 $
- The total length of strings $ s_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 3000 $
The input limitations for getting 100 points are:
- $ 1<=k<=10^{18} $
- $ 1<=m<=10^{4} $
- The total length of strings $ s_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $
Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each string $ s_{i} $ print the number of times it occurs in the given Fibonacci string as a substring. Since the numbers can be large enough, print them modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ . Print the answers for the strings in the order in which they are given in the input.</div>
