<h1>Polycarp&#039;s Pockets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
输入$n$个数，输出其中最多有多少个数是相同的。
输入格式：
第一行为一个整数$n$ ( 1 $\le$ $n$ $\le$ 100 ) , 第二行为$n$个整数。
输出格式：
一个整数，表示其中最多相同的数的个数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp has $ n $ coins, the value of the $ i $ -th coin is $ a_i $ . Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.
For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array $ a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2] $ , he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: $ [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] $ .
Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of coins.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ ) — values of coins.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.</div>
