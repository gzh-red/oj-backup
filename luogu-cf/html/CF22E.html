<h1>Scheme</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求让该图变成强联通图至少增加多少边并输出边</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>To learn as soon as possible the latest news about their favourite fundamentally new operating system, BolgenOS community from Nizhni Tagil decided to develop a scheme. According to this scheme a community member, who is the first to learn the news, calls some other member, the latter, in his turn, calls some third member, and so on; i.e. a person with index $ i $ got a person with index $ f_{i} $ , to whom he has to call, if he learns the news. With time BolgenOS community members understood that their scheme doesn't work sometimes — there were cases when some members didn't learn the news at all. Now they want to supplement the scheme: they add into the scheme some instructions of type $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ , which mean that person $ x_{i} $ has to call person $ y_{i} $ as well. What is the minimum amount of instructions that they need to add so, that at the end everyone learns the news, no matter who is the first to learn it?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains number $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — amount of BolgenOS community members. The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integer numbers $ f_{i} $ ( $ 1<=f_{i}<=n,i≠f_{i} $ ) — index of a person, to whom calls a person with index $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line output one number — the minimum amount of instructions to add. Then output one of the possible variants to add these instructions into the scheme, one instruction in each line. If the solution is not unique, output any.</div>
