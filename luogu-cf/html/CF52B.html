<h1>Right Triangles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：输入一个nm的矩阵，只包含‘.’和‘’两种字符。你的任务是数出所有的“Right Triangle”。‘Right Triangle’的定义是该三角形有两条边平行于矩阵的边界，并且直角点落在‘*’的中心。一个'Right Triangle'是有一个直角的三角形。
输入：第一行两个整数n,m，接下来是该矩阵
输出：一个数，整个矩阵上'Right Triangle'的个数。请c++选手不要使用%lld（p选手不要用%l64d），用cout会更好（建议来自原题）

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a $ n×m $ field consisting only of periods ('.') and asterisks ('\*'). Your task is to count all right triangles with two sides parallel to the square sides, whose vertices are in the centers of '\*'-cells. A right triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (that is, a 90 degree angle).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two positive integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1000 $ ). The following $ n $ lines consist of $ m $ characters each, describing the field. Only '.' and '\*' are allowed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single number — total number of square triangles in the field. Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).</div>
