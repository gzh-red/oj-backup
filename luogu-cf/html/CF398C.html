<h1>Tree and Array</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>User ainta likes trees. This time he is going to make an undirected tree with $ n $ vertices numbered by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The tree is weighted, so each edge of the tree will have some integer weight.
Also he has an array $ t $ : $ t[1],t[2],...,t[n] $ . At first all the elements of the array are initialized to $ 0 $ . Then for each edge connecting vertices $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ u&lt;v $ ) of the tree with weight $ c $ , ainta adds value $ c $ to the elements $ t[u],t[u+1],...,t[v-1],t[v] $ of array $ t $ .
Let's assume that $ d(u,v) $ is the total weight of edges on the shortest path between vertex $ u $ and vertex $ v $ . User ainta calls a pair of integers $ x,y $ ( $ 1<=x&lt;y<=n $ ) good if and only if $ d(x,y)=t[x]+t[x+1]+...+t[y-1]+t[y] $ .
User ainta wants to make at least ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF398C/d289004abb1deda75bd015b817d8e89f3dffdc1a.png) good pairs, but he couldn't make a proper tree. Help ainta to find such a tree.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 5<=n<=10^{5} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n-1 $ lines containing the description of the edges. The $ i $ -th line should contain three space-separated integers $ u_{i},v_{i},c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i}&lt;v_{i}<=n; 1<=c_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — two vertices connected by the edge, and the weight of the edge.
Next print ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF398C/d289004abb1deda75bd015b817d8e89f3dffdc1a.png) lines containing the good pairs. The $ k $ -th line should contain two space-separated integers $ x_{k} $ and $ y_{k} $ ( $ 1<=x_{k}&lt;y_{k}<=n $ ). Of course, $ x_{k},y_{k} $ must be a good pair. All pairs should be distinct — that is, for all $ j,k $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF398C/eded318345fe4bfa1a0ddcf83d7da297b7a9245e.png), $ x_{j}≠x_{k} $ or $ y_{j}≠y_{k} $ must be satisfied.
If there are many correct solutions, print any of them.</div>

You can find the definition of a tree by the following link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\_(graph\_theory)
You can also find the definition of the shortest path by the following link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest\_path\_problem
The tree and the array $ t $ in the sample output look like this:
