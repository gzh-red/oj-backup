<h1>Block Tower</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个$n \times m$的矩形，'.'表示空地，'#'表示这个地方有一个大洞（即不能造建筑）。
你可以在空地上造建筑，建筑有两种，一种是蓝色的，可以容纳$100$人，能建造在任何位置，还有一种是红色的，可以容纳$200$人，它必须被建造在蓝色建筑的边上，也就是说红色建筑的上下左右必须有一位置上有蓝色建筑。同时你可以对建筑进行拆除，但是拆除蓝房子不影响已经建造的红房子。
问怎样建造能容纳的人总数最多，并输出任意一个方案（不要求操作数最小化）。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After too much playing on paper, Iahub has switched to computer games. The game he plays is called "Block Towers". It is played in a rectangular grid with $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns (it contains $ n×m $ cells). The goal of the game is to build your own city. Some cells in the grid are big holes, where Iahub can't build any building. The rest of cells are empty. In some empty cell Iahub can build exactly one tower of two following types:
1. Blue towers. Each has population limit equal to $ 100 $ .
2. Red towers. Each has population limit equal to $ 200 $ . However, it can be built in some cell only if in that moment at least one of the neighbouring cells has a Blue Tower. Two cells are neighbours is they share a side.
Iahub is also allowed to destroy a building from any cell. He can do this operation as much as he wants. After destroying a building, the other buildings are not influenced, and the destroyed cell becomes empty (so Iahub can build a tower in this cell if needed, see the second example for such a case).
Iahub can convince as many population as he wants to come into his city. So he needs to configure his city to allow maximum population possible. Therefore he should find a sequence of operations that builds the city in an optimal way, so that total population limit is as large as possible.
He says he's the best at this game, but he doesn't have the optimal solution. Write a program that calculates the optimal one, to show him that he's not as good as he thinks.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=500 $ ). Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters, describing the grid. The $ j $ -th character in the $ i $ -th line is '.' if you're allowed to build at the cell with coordinates $ (i,j) $ a tower (empty cell) or '\#' if there is a big hole there.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print an integer $ k $ in the first line $ (0<=k<=10^{6}) $ — the number of operations Iahub should perform to obtain optimal result.
Each of the following $ k $ lines must contain a single operation in the following format:
1. «B x y» $ (1<=x<=n,1<=y<=m) $ — building a blue tower at the cell $ (x,y) $ ;
2. «R x y» $ (1<=x<=n,1<=y<=m) $ — building a red tower at the cell $ (x,y) $ ;
3. «D x y» $ (1<=x<=n,1<=y<=m) $ — destroying a tower at the cell $ (x,y) $ .
If there are multiple solutions you can output any of them. Note, that you shouldn't minimize the number of operations.</div>
