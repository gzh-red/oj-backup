<h1>Have You Ever Heard About the Word?</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个字符串$S$ ,要求你每次找到一个最短的并且最左边的形如$XX$ (即由两个相同的字符串拼接而成)的子串,然后把这个字符串从$XX$ 变成$X$
问无法操作后的字符串是什么?
$|S|\le5\times10^4$
感谢@Kelin 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, string bca is substring of string abcabc, but string cc is not.
A repeating block is a string formed by concatenating some string with itself. So, string abcabc is a repeating block, but strings abcabd, ababab are not.
You've got a sequence of Latin characters (string). At each step you find the shortest substring that is a repeating block, if there exists more than one you must choose the leftmost. As the substring is of form $ XX $ ( $ X $ — some string) you replace this substring with $ X $ , in other words you delete one of the $ X $ substrings in the substring. You repeat this process until there remains no repeating block in the string.
How would the final string looks like? Look at the sample explanation to understand the statement more precise.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input you're given a string of small Latin characters with length between $ 1 $ to $ 50000 $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the final string after applying changes.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>abccabc
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>abc
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>aaaabaaab
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>ab
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>birdbirdbirdistheword
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>birdistheword
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>At the first sample the string transforms as follows: abccabc $ → $ abcabc $ → $ abc.
At the second sample the string transforms as follows: aaaabaaab $ → $ aaabaaab $ → $ aabaaab $ → $ abaaab $ → $ abaab $ → $ abab $ → $ ab.</div>
