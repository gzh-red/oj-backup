<h1>Nearest Minimums</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为n的整数数组，请找出最小值之间的最短距离。保证最小值在数组中至少出现2次。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array of $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{n-1} $ . Find the distance between two closest (nearest) minimums in it. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
找到一个长度为n的序列中，距离最短的最小值的距离。</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains positive integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — size of the given array. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{n-1} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only number — distance between two nearest minimums in the array.</div>
