<h1>HQ9+【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一行字符串，如果里面含有"H""Q""9"，输出"YES"，否则输出"NO"。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:
- "H" prints "Hello, World!",
- "Q" prints the whole source code of the program itself (at each call),
- "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,
- "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.
Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.
You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input will consist of a single line $ p $ which will give a program in HQ9+. String $ p $ will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of $ p $ will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Hello!
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>VK_Cup_2012!
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case the program contains only one instruction — "H", which prints "Hello, World!".
In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.</div>
