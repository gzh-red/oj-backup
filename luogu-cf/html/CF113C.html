<h1>Double Happiness</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述**
给定闭区间$ [l,r] $，找出区间内满足$ t=a^{2}+b^{2} $的所有素数$ t $的个数（
$ a,b $为任意正整数）.
**输入格式**
输入只有一行
给定两个正整数$ l,r $表示区间范围
**输出格式**
输出一个数字 表示共有多少个素数t </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>On the math lesson a teacher asked each pupil to come up with his own lucky numbers. As a fan of number theory Peter chose prime numbers. Bob was more original. He said that number $ t $ is his lucky number, if it can be represented as:
$ t=a^{2}+b^{2}, $ where $ a,b $ are arbitrary positive integers.Now, the boys decided to find out how many days of the interval $ [l,r] $ ( $ l<=r $ ) are suitable for pair programming. They decided that the day $ i $ ( $ l<=i<=r $ ) is suitable for pair programming if and only if the number $ i $ is lucky for Peter and lucky for Bob at the same time. Help the boys to find the number of such days.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer numbers $ l,r $ ( $ 1<=l,r<=3·10^{8} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line print the number of days on the segment $ [l,r] $ , which are lucky for Peter and Bob at the same time.</div>
