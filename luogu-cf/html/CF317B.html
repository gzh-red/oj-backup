<h1>Ants</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>平面直角坐标系中，初始时在(0,0)处有n只蚂蚁。
每分钟，如果存在一个位置(x,y)的蚂蚁数量至少为4，
那么这4只蚂蚁将分别向四个方向移动：(x+1,y)(x-1,y)(x,y-1)(x,y+1)。
如果存在多个位置蚂蚁数量都>=4,这些位置上的蚂蚁将同时按上述方式向四个方向移动，且互不干扰。
求当所有蚂蚁停止移动时，某个位置上的蚂蚁数量。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It has been noted that if some ants are put in the junctions of the graphene integer lattice then they will act in the following fashion: every minute at each junction ( $ x $ , $ y $ ) containing at least four ants a group of four ants will be formed, and these four ants will scatter to the neighbouring junctions ( $ x+1 $ , $ y $ ), ( $ x-1 $ , $ y $ ), ( $ x $ , $ y+1 $ ), ( $ x $ , $ y-1 $ ) — one ant in each direction. No other ant movements will happen. Ants never interfere with each other.
Scientists have put a colony of $ n $ ants into the junction (0, 0) and now they wish to know how many ants will there be at some given junctions, when the movement of the ants stops.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First input line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=30000 $ ) and $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=50000 $ ), where $ n $ is the number of ants in the colony and $ t $ is the number of queries. Each of the next $ t $ lines contains coordinates of a query junction: integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). Queries may coincide.
It is guaranteed that there will be a certain moment of time when no possible movements can happen (in other words, the process will eventually end).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ t $ integers, one per line — the number of ants at the corresponding junctions when the movement of the ants stops.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the colony consists of the one ant, so nothing happens at all.
In the second sample the colony consists of 6 ants. At the first minute 4 ants scatter from (0, 0) to the neighbouring junctions. After that the process stops.</div>
