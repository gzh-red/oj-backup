<h1>Game with Powers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya and Petya wrote down all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ to play the "powers" game ( $ n $ can be quite large; however, Vasya and Petya are not confused by this fact).
Players choose numbers in turn (Vasya chooses first). If some number $ x $ is chosen at the current turn, it is forbidden to choose $ x $ or all of its other positive integer powers (that is, $ x^{2} $ , $ x^{3} $ , $ ... $ ) at the next turns. For instance, if the number $ 9 $ is chosen at the first turn, one cannot choose $ 9 $ or $ 81 $ later, while it is still allowed to choose $ 3 $ or $ 27 $ . The one who cannot make a move loses.
Who wins if both Vasya and Petya play optimally?</div>
