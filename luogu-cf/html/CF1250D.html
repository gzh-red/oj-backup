<h1>Conference Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A large-scale conference on unnatural sciences is going to be held soon in Berland! In total, $ n $ scientists from all around the world have applied. All of them have indicated a time segment when they will attend the conference: two integers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ — day of arrival and day of departure.
Also, some of the scientists have indicated their country, while some preferred not to. So, each scientist also has a value $ c_i $ , where:
- $ c_i > 0 $ , if the scientist is coming from country $ c_i $ (all countries are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ 200 $ );
- $ c_i = 0 $ , if the scientist preferred to not indicate the country.
Everyone knows that it is interesting and useful to chat with representatives of other countries! A participant of the conference will be upset if she will not meet people from other countries during the stay. It is possible to meet people during all time of stay, including the day of arrival and the day of departure.
Conference organizers need to be ready for the worst! They are interested in the largest number $ x $ , that it is possible that among all people attending the conference exactly $ x $ will be upset.
Help the organizers to find the maximum number of upset scientists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) — number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 500 $ ) — the number of registered conference participants.
Next $ n $ lines follow, each containing three integers $ l_i $ , $ r_i $ , $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^6 $ , $ 0 \le c_i \le 200 $ ) — the day of arrival, the day of departure and the country (or the fact that it was not indicated) for the $ i $ -th participant.
The sum of $ n $ among all test cases in the input does not exceed $ 500 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ t $ integers — maximum number of upset scientists for each test case.</div>
