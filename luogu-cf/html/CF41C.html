<h1>Email address</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>将一个字符串转换成一个正确的电子邮件地址
有两种操作：
①将子串“dot“转换为‘.’（小数点）
②将子串”at“转换为‘@’
一个正确的电子邮件地址满足以下条件：
①只包含小数点(.)，符号(@)和小写的拉丁字母
②不以一个点开始，也不以点结束
③不以一个‘@’符号开头或结尾
④恰好包含一个‘@’，但它可能包含任何东东
⑤使得电子邮件地址尽可能地短，如果长度相同则输出字典序最小的</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sometimes one has to spell email addresses over the phone. Then one usually pronounces a dot as dot, an at sign as at. As a result, we get something like vasyaatgmaildotcom. Your task is to transform it into a proper email address (vasya@gmail.com).
It is known that a proper email address contains only such symbols as . @ and lower-case Latin letters, doesn't start with and doesn't end with a dot. Also, a proper email address doesn't start with and doesn't end with an at sign. Moreover, an email address contains exactly one such symbol as @, yet may contain any number (possible, zero) of dots.
You have to carry out a series of replacements so that the length of the result was as short as possible and it was a proper email address. If the lengths are equal, you should print the lexicographically minimal result.
Overall, two variants of replacement are possible: dot can be replaced by a dot, at can be replaced by an at.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the email address description. It is guaranteed that that is a proper email address with all the dots replaced by dot an the at signs replaced by at. The line is not empty and its length does not exceed 100 symbols.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the shortest email address, from which the given line could be made by the described above replacements. If there are several solutions to that problem, print the lexicographically minimal one (the lexicographical comparison of the lines are implemented with an operator < in modern programming languages).
In the ASCII table the symbols go in this order: . @ ab...z</div>
