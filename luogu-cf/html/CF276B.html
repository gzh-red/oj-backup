玩家轮流移动; 玩家可以从字符串s中删除任意字母。
如果轮到他时，他之前的玩家可以对字符串s中的字母进行重新排序以获得回文串，则他获胜。
确定哪个玩家将获胜。双方都打得最好！
输入格式：
一个全是小写字母字符串
输出格式
第一个人赢输出“First”，否则输出“Second”。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Little Girl loves problems on games very much. Here's one of them.
Two players have got a string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:
- The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from string $ s $ .
- If the player before his turn can reorder the letters in string $ s $ so as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string "abba" is a palindrome and string "abc" isn't.
Determine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well — the one who moves first or the one who moves second.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains a single line, containing string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=10^{3} $ ). String $ s $ consists of lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print word "First" if the first player wins (provided that both players play optimally well). Otherwise, print word "Second". Print the words without the quotes.</div>
