<h1>Quadratic equation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求一元二次方程的解。有几个输出几个，差在$10^{-4}$以内算对。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a quadratic equation with integer coefficients $ A*X^{2}+B*X+C=0 $ . It is guaranteed that $ A≠0 $ and that the equation has at least one real root. Output the roots of the equation.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of input contains integers $ A,B $ and $ C $ ( $ -1000<=A,B,C<=1000,A≠0 $ ), separated by spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the roots of the equation in increasing order. If the equation has a single root of multiplicity 2, output it once. The root is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-4} $ .</div>
