<h1>Sort the Table【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rectangular table containing words. Each of its columns has its own name. You are also given the list of rules of sorting in form "FIELD\_NAME SORT\_ORDER", where SORT\_ORDER is either ASC (nondescending order) or DESC (nonascending order). Rules in the list are separated by a single comma with a single space. You have to sort rows of the table primarily by the first rule, then, in case of a tie sort by the second rule. And so on. If two rows are equal in terms of every rule, then preserve their relative order. You can assume that each element of the table has type "string", so you have to use lexicographic comparison.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains column names. The second line contains the list of rules. The rest of the input data contains the table. All the words and column names are separated by single spaces. The number of rows and columns is between 1 and 100, inclusive. Names of columns and elements are strings containing only uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and digits, having the length between 1 and 10, inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the table after the sorting.</div>
