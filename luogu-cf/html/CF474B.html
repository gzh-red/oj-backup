<h1>Worms</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch.
Marmot brought Mole $ n $ ordered piles of worms such that $ i $ -th pile contains $ a_{i} $ worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers $ 1 $ to $ a_{1} $ , worms in second pile are labeled with numbers $ a_{1}+1 $ to $ a_{1}+a_{2} $ and so on. See the example for a better understanding.
Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.
Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.</div>
