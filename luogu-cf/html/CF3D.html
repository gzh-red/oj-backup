<h1>Least Cost Bracket Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个序列，序列里面会有左括号、问号、右括号。对于一个‘？’而言，可以将其替换为一个‘（’，也可以替换成一个‘）’，但是都有相应的代价。问：如何替换使得代价最小。前提是替换之后的序列中，括号是匹配的。如果不能替换为一个括号匹配的序列则输出-1。
------------
### 输入
第一行是序列，序列长度不超过5.10^4，下面m(m是？的数量)行有每行2个数据，第一个是**'（'**的代价，第2个是**'）'**的代价
### 输出：第一行打印代价，第二行打印替换后的序列。不行输出-1

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is yet another problem on regular bracket sequences.
A bracket sequence is called regular, if by inserting "+" and "1" into it we get a correct mathematical expression. For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are regular, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not. You have a pattern of a bracket sequence that consists of characters "(", ")" and "?". You have to replace each character "?" with a bracket so, that you get a regular bracket sequence.
For each character "?" the cost of its replacement with "(" and ")" is given. Among all the possible variants your should choose the cheapest.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a non-empty pattern of even length, consisting of characters "(", ")" and "?". Its length doesn't exceed $ 5·10^{4} $ . Then there follow $ m $ lines, where $ m $ is the number of characters "?" in the pattern. Each line contains two integer numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=10^{6} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the cost of replacing the $ i $ -th character "?" with an opening bracket, and $ b_{i} $ — with a closing one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the cost of the optimal regular bracket sequence in the first line, and the required sequence in the second.
Print -1, if there is no answer. If the answer is not unique, print any of them.</div>
