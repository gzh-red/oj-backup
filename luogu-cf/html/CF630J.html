<h1>Divisibility</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个数n，求在[1,n]范围内有几个数能被2到10之间的所有整数整除（n<=$10^{18}$）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>IT City company developing computer games invented a new way to reward its employees. After a new game release users start buying it actively, and the company tracks the number of sales with precision to each transaction.
