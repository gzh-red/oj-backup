<h1>Little Artem and Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Artem is given a graph, constructed as follows: start with some $ k $ -clique, then add new vertices one by one, connecting them to $ k $ already existing vertices that form a $ k $ -clique.
Artem wants to count the number of spanning trees in this graph modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ , $ 1<=k<=min(n,5) $ ) — the total size of the graph and the size of the initial clique, respectively.
Next $ n-k $ lines describe $ k+1 $ -th, $ k+2 $ -th, ..., $ i $ -th, ..., $ n $ -th vertices by listing $ k $ distinct vertex indices $ 1<=a_{ij}&lt;i $ it is connected to. It is guaranteed that those vertices form a k-clique.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the number of spanning trees in the given graph modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
