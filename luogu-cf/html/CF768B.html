0 ≤ n < 250, 0 ≤ r − l ≤ 105</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jon fought bravely to rescue the wildlings who were attacked by the white-walkers at Hardhome. On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility.
Initially Sam has a list with a single element $ n $ . Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element $ x $ , such that $ x&gt;1 $ , from the list and insert at the same position ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF768B/465cdad41298994952ff82579429cb3d1de6dea4.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF768B/42f87a6d55a7d4b8ea353aaf2fcb56c13744febb.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF768B/465cdad41298994952ff82579429cb3d1de6dea4.png) sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ .
Now the masters want the total number of $ 1 $ s in the range $ l $ to $ r $ ( $ 1 $ -indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ l $ , $ r $ ( $ 0<=n&lt;2^{50} $ , $ 0<=r-l<=10^{5} $ , $ r>=1 $ , $ l>=1 $ ) – initial element and the range $ l $ to $ r $ .
It is guaranteed that $ r $ is not greater than the length of the final list.</div>
