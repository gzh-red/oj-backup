<h1>Round House</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>废龙小朋友居住在一间圆形的房屋里。这所房屋的所有门都被用数字1~n标号了。门口n与门口1是连起来的。
现在给你3个数n,a,b，废龙的房子有n个门口，他打算从门口a开始走过b个门口，问你最后废龙会站在哪个门口前面。
若b为负数，就是指废龙要倒♂车，即，他要倒着走。
样例1的解释：
![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/pic/47140.png)
一共有6个门口，从2号门口开始，走-5个门口，最后停在了3号门口。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Entrance $ n $ and entrance $ 1 $ are adjacent.
Today Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance $ a $ and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house $ b $ entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance $ n $ should be followed by entrance $ 1 $ ). The negative value of $ b $ corresponds to moving $ |b| $ entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance $ 1 $ is followed by entrance $ n $ ). If $ b=0 $ , then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance.
