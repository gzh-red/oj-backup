<h1>Fibonacci-ish</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Yash最近迷上了fibonacci数列，他定义了一种数列叫fibonacccccci数列：
1． 这个数列包含至少2个元素；
2． f[0]和f[1]是任意选取的；
3． f[n+2]=f[n+1]+f[n] (n>=0)；
现在，给出一个数列a[1..n]，你可以改变数列元素的顺序，使得a[1..m]
满足fibonacccccci数列的条件，请求出最大的m。
【输入数据】
第一行1个数n，表示数列长度</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Yash has recently learnt about the Fibonacci sequence and is very excited about it. He calls a sequence Fibonacci-ish if
1. the sequence consists of at least two elements
2. $ f_{0} $ and $ f_{1} $ are arbitrary
3. $ f_{n+2}=f_{n+1}+f_{n} $ for all $ n>=0 $ .
You are given some sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Your task is rearrange elements of this sequence in such a way that its longest possible prefix is Fibonacci-ish sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=1000 $ ) — the length of the sequence $ a_{i} $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ |a_{i}|<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the length of the longest possible Fibonacci-ish prefix of the given sequence after rearrangement.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, if we rearrange elements of the sequence as $ -1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 1 $ , the whole sequence $ a_{i} $ would be Fibonacci-ish.
In the second sample, the optimal way to rearrange elements is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF633D/d3ff4ea2c12e52c9ca4c15e14139f2b01f478bed.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF633D/67db7509088e9e5340d450cc0af986d1466ce169.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF633D/7be78903e0b1130fefbb3533b84d31cf4efaa940.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF633D/0d98505f3f5d3d9cd5c06747ea4bb30d03a8d1e8.png), $ 28 $ .</div>
