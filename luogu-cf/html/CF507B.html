<h1>Amr and Pins</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Amr loves Geometry. One day he came up with a very interesting problem.
Amr has a circle of radius $ r $ and center in point $ (x,y) $ . He wants the circle center to be in new position $ (x',y') $ .
In one step Amr can put a pin to the border of the circle in a certain point, then rotate the circle around that pin by any angle and finally remove the pin.
Help Amr to achieve his goal in minimum number of steps.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of 5 space-separated integers $ r $ , $ x $ , $ y $ , $ x' $ $ y' $ ( $ 1<=r<=10^{5} $ , $ -10^{5}<=x,y,x',y'<=10^{5} $ ), circle radius, coordinates of original center of the circle and coordinates of destination center of the circle respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — minimum number of steps required to move the center of the circle to the destination point.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test the optimal way is to put a pin at point $ (0,2) $ and rotate the circle by $ 180 $ degrees counter-clockwise (or clockwise, no matter).
