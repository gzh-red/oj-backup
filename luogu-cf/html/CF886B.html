<h1>Vlad and Cafes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n个数字,求最后一次出现最早的数字.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vlad likes to eat in cafes very much. During his life, he has visited cafes $ n $ times. Unfortunately, Vlad started to feel that his last visits are not any different from each other. To fix that Vlad had a small research.
First of all, Vlad assigned individual indices to all cafes. Then, he wrote down indices of cafes he visited in a row, in order of visiting them. Now, Vlad wants to find such a cafe that his last visit to that cafe was before his last visits to every other cafe. In other words, he wants to find such a cafe that he hasn't been there for as long as possible. Help Vlad to find that cafe.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In first line there is one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — number of cafes indices written by Vlad.
In second line, $ n $ numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=2·10^{5} $ ) are written — indices of cafes in order of being visited by Vlad. Vlad could visit some cafes more than once. Note that in numeration, some indices could be omitted.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — index of the cafe that Vlad hasn't visited for as long as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
1 3 2 1 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6
2 1 2 2 4 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first test, there are three cafes, and the last visits to cafes with indices $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ were after the last visit to cafe with index $ 3 $ ; so this cafe is the answer.
In second test case, there are also three cafes, but with indices $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ . Cafes with indices $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ were visited after the last visit of cafe with index $ 2 $ , so the answer is $ 2 $ . Note that Vlad could omit some numbers while numerating the cafes.</div>
