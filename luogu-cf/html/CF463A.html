<h1>Caisa and Sugar</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Caisa is going to have a party and he needs to buy the ingredients for a big chocolate cake. For that he is going to the biggest supermarket in town.
Unfortunately, he has just $ s $ dollars for sugar. But that's not a reason to be sad, because there are $ n $ types of sugar in the supermarket, maybe he able to buy one. But that's not all. The supermarket has very unusual exchange politics: instead of cents the sellers give sweets to a buyer as a change. Of course, the number of given sweets always doesn't exceed $ 99 $ , because each seller maximizes the number of dollars in the change ( $ 100 $ cents can be replaced with a dollar).
Caisa wants to buy only one type of sugar, also he wants to maximize the number of sweets in the change. What is the maximum number of sweets he can get? Note, that Caisa doesn't want to minimize the cost of the sugar, he only wants to get maximum number of sweets as change.</div>
