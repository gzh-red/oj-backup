<h1>Jamie and Alarm Snooze</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Jamie非常喜欢睡觉。一天，他决定要在hh:mm的时候起床。然而，他也非常讨厌起床，所以他想把闹钟设置在一个幸运的时间。接着他按下一个神奇的按钮（贪睡按钮），它可以使闹钟在x分钟后响，直到hh:mm。现在，他想知道他至少要按多少次贪睡按钮。
若hh:mm中包含数字7，则它是幸运的，其它时间都不是幸运的。比如，13:07，17:27是幸运的，00:48，21:34则不是。
注意：闹钟设置的时间和hh:mm不一定要在同一天，Jamie的闹钟是24小时制的，在23:59后是00:00。
输入输出格式
输入：
第一行：x；
第二行：hh mm（中间有一个空格）（00≤hh≤23,00≤mm≤59）。
输出：
仅一行：Jamie最少需要按下神奇按（hai）钮（luo）的次数。
说明 在第一个样例中，Jaime需要在11:23起床。所以他可以将闹钟设置在11:17，并按下两次贪睡按钮。
在第二个样例中，Jaime可以直接将闹钟设置在01:07,因为它本身就是幸运的。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jamie loves sleeping. One day, he decides that he needs to wake up at exactly $ hh:mm $ . However, he hates waking up, so he wants to make waking up less painful by setting the alarm at a lucky time. He will then press the snooze button every $ x $ minutes until $ hh:mm $ is reached, and only then he will wake up. He wants to know what is the smallest number of times he needs to press the snooze button.
A time is considered lucky if it contains a digit ' $ 7 $ '. For example, $ 13:07 $ and $ 17:27 $ are lucky, while $ 00:48 $ and $ 21:34 $ are not lucky.
Note that it is not necessary that the time set for the alarm and the wake-up time are on the same day. It is guaranteed that there is a lucky time Jamie can set so that he can wake at $ hh:mm $ .
Formally, find the smallest possible non-negative integer $ y $ such that the time representation of the time $ x·y $ minutes before $ hh:mm $ contains the digit ' $ 7 $ '.
Jamie uses 24-hours clock, so after $ 23:59 $ comes $ 00:00 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=60 $ ).
The second line contains two two-digit integers, $ hh $ and $ mm $ ( $ 00<=hh<=23,00<=mm<=59 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of times he needs to press the button.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Jamie needs to wake up at 11:23. So, he can set his alarm at 11:17. He would press the snooze button when the alarm rings at 11:17 and at 11:20.
In the second sample, Jamie can set his alarm at exactly at 01:07 which is lucky.</div>
