<h1>Gargari and Permutations</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
给你k个长度为n的排列，求这些排列的最长公共子序列的长度
## 输入格式
第一行包含n(1<=n<=1000)和k(2<=k<=5)。
后面的k行分别表示k个排列。
## 输出格式
输出最长公共子序列的长度
## 说明
第一个测试样本的答案是子序列[1,2,3]。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Gargari got bored to play with the bishops and now, after solving the problem about them, he is trying to do math homework. In a math book he have found $ k $ permutations. Each of them consists of numbers $ 1,2,...,n $ in some order. Now he should find the length of the longest common subsequence of these permutations. Can you help Gargari?
You can read about longest common subsequence there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest\_common\_subsequence\_problem</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n<=1000; 2<=k<=5) $ . Each of the next $ k $ lines contains integers $ 1,2,...,n $ in some order — description of the current permutation.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the length of the longest common subsequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 3
1 4 2 3
4 1 2 3
1 2 4 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The answer for the first test sample is subsequence \[1, 2, 3\].</div>
