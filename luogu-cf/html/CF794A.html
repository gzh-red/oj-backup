<h1>Bank Robbery</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个强盗企图抢劫银行，但没能完成他的任务。然而，他设法打开了所有的保险箱。
奥列格银行客户喜欢钱（谁不喜欢），并决定利用这次失败的抢劫，从保险箱偷一些钱。有许多保险柜排成一列，从左边起的第一个保险柜被称为保险柜。所有保险箱总共有N张钞票。第一张钞票在保险箱里。
奥列格现在安全了。有两个保安，其中一个守卫保险箱B，使B<A美元，即第一个警卫在Oleg的左边。另一个守卫守卫着保险箱C，所以C>A，也就是说，他在Oleg的右边。
两个卫兵很懒，所以他们不动。每隔一秒钟，奥列格就可以从当前保险柜中取出所有的钞票，或者转移到邻近的任何保险柜。但是，他不能在任何时候去任何由保安看守的保险箱，因为他可能会被指控偷窃。确定Oleg可以收集的纸币的最大数量。
输入的第一行包含三个空格分隔的整数a、b和c（1<=b&lt；a&lt；c<=10^9），分别表示Oleg、第一个安全防护和第二个安全防护的位置。
下一行输入包含一个整数n（1<=n<=10^5 1<=n<=10^5），表示钞票的数量。
下一行输入包含n个空格分隔的整数x[1]，x[2]…，x[n]（1<=x[i]<=10^9），表示x[i]-th钞票位于x[i]-th保险柜中。请注意，x[i]不能保证是不同的。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A robber has attempted to rob a bank but failed to complete his task. However, he had managed to open all the safes.
Oleg the bank client loves money (who doesn't), and decides to take advantage of this failed robbery and steal some money from the safes. There are many safes arranged in a line, where the $ i $ -th safe from the left is called safe $ i $ . There are $ n $ banknotes left in all the safes in total. The $ i $ -th banknote is in safe $ x_{i} $ . Oleg is now at safe $ a $ . There are two security guards, one of which guards the safe $ b $ such that $ b&lt;a $ , i.e. the first guard is to the left of Oleg. The other guard guards the safe $ c $ so that $ c&gt;a $ , i.e. he is to the right of Oleg.
The two guards are very lazy, so they do not move. In every second, Oleg can either take all the banknotes from the current safe or move to any of the neighboring safes. However, he cannot visit any safe that is guarded by security guards at any time, becaues he might be charged for stealing. Determine the maximum amount of banknotes Oleg can gather.</div>

<div>The first line of input contains three space-separated integers, $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 1<=b&lt;a&lt;c<=10^{9} $ ), denoting the positions of Oleg, the first security guard and the second security guard, respectively.
The next line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ), denoting the number of banknotes.
The next line of input contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), denoting that the $ i $ -th banknote is located in the $ x_{i} $ -th safe. Note that $ x_{i} $ are not guaranteed to be distinct.</div>

<div>In the first example Oleg can take the banknotes in positions $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 6 $ (note that there are $ 2 $ banknotes at position $ 5 $ ). Oleg can't take the banknotes in safes $ 7 $ and $ 8 $ because he can't run into the second security guard. Similarly, Oleg cannot take the banknotes at positions $ 3 $ and $ 2 $ because he can't run into the first security guard. Thus, he can take a maximum of $ 4 $ banknotes.
For the second sample, Oleg can't take any banknotes without bumping into any of the security guards.</div>
