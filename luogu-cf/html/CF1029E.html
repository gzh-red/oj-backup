<h1>Tree with Small Distances</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
给定一棵树。要求往树中加入一些边使得从1到其他节点的距离至多是2 。
输出加入边的最小数量。(边全部都是无向的)
# 输入格式
第一行一个整数n，表示树中的节点个数。
接下来n−1行，每行两个整数x,y,表示x,y之间有一条连边。
# 输出格式
输出一个整数，表示加入边的最小数量。
# 数据范围
对于30%的数据n≤10。对于70%的数据n≤100。对于100%的数据n≤105。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an undirected tree consisting of $ n $ vertices. An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $ n - 1 $ edges.
Your task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex $ 1 $ to any other vertex is at most $ 2 $ . Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The following $ n - 1 $ lines contain edges: edge $ i $ is given as a pair of vertices $ u_i, v_i $ ( $ 1 \le u_i, v_i \le n $ ). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex $ 1 $ to any other vertex at most $ 2 $ . Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.</div>
