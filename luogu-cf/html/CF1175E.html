<h1>Minimal Segment Cover</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n个形如[l,r]的线段。m次询问，每次询问区间[x,y]，问至少选出几条线段，使得区间[x,y]的任何一个部位都被至少一条线段覆盖。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ intervals in form $ [l; r] $ on a number line.
You are also given $ m $ queries in form $ [x; y] $ . What is the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from $ x $ to $ y $ is covered by at least one of them?
If you can't choose intervals so that every point from $ x $ to $ y $ is covered, then print -1 for that query.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of intervals and the number of queries, respectively.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integer numbers $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 0 \le l_i < r_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the given intervals.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integer numbers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 0 \le x_i < y_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the queries.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ integer numbers. The $ i $ -th number should be the answer to the $ i $ -th query: either the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from $ x_i $ to $ y_i $ is covered by at least one of them or -1 if you can't choose intervals so that every point from $ x_i $ to $ y_i $ is covered.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example there are three queries:
1. query $ [1; 3] $ can be covered by interval $ [1; 3] $ ;
2. query $ [1; 4] $ can be covered by intervals $ [1; 3] $ and $ [2; 4] $ . There is no way to cover $ [1; 4] $ by a single interval;
3. query $ [3; 4] $ can be covered by interval $ [2; 4] $ . It doesn't matter that the other points are covered besides the given query.
In the second example there are four queries:
1. query $ [1; 2] $ can be covered by interval $ [1; 3] $ . Note that you can choose any of the two given intervals $ [1; 3] $ ;
2. query $ [1; 3] $ can be covered by interval $ [1; 3] $ ;
3. query $ [1; 4] $ can't be covered by any set of intervals;
4. query $ [1; 5] $ can't be covered by any set of intervals. Note that intervals $ [1; 3] $ and $ [4; 5] $ together don't cover $ [1; 5] $ because even non-integer points should be covered. Here $ 3.5 $ , for example, isn't covered.</div>
