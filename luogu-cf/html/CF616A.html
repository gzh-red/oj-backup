<h1>Comparing Two Long Integers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>比较两个不超过1000000位的正整数的大小.正整数可能有前导零.前面那个比后面那个大输出">",比后面那个小输出"<",两个一样大输出"=".
翻译贡献者：Fuko_Ibuki</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two very long integers $ a,b $ (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number $ a $ or $ b $ is greater or determine that they are equal.
The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.
As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw\_input().</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a non-negative integer $ a $ .
The second line contains a non-negative integer $ b $ .
The numbers $ a,b $ may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than $ 10^{6} $ digits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the symbol "<" if $ a<b $ and the symbol ">" if $ a>b $ . If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".</div>
