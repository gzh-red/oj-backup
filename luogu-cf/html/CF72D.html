<h1>Perse-script</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two good friends were trying to make a new programming language called Perse-script.
The most important part of this language is strings. A string in Perse-script is put between characters "
So for example "Hello" is a string. But Hello is a variable name or a keyword, which are not considered in this problem.
Perse-script is function-based. So there are no operators in this language. For example for summing two numbers you have to write sum(a,b) and not a+b.
There are several functions for working on strings. These include:
- concat(x,y) is a function which gets two strings $ x $ and $ y $ and puts $ y $ at the end of $ x $ and returns the result. For example concat("Hello","World") returns "HelloWorld".
- reverse(x) gets a single string $ x $ and reverses it. For example reverse("Hello") returns "olleH".
- substr(x,a,b) gets a string $ x $ and two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a<=b<=n $ , where $ n $ is the length of $ x $ ). And returns the substring of $ x $ between indexes $ a $ and $ b $ , inclusive. For example substr("Hello",2,4) returns "ell".
- substr(x,a,b,c) is another version of substr which works just like the last one but $ c $ is the step of adding. $ c $ is positive. For example substr("HelloWorld",1,10,2) returns "Hlool". This substr means that you put the $ a $ th character , and then every $ c $ th character until you reach $ b $ .
You're going to manipulate the string part of Perse-script. Given a string expression, you should print its result. It is guaranteed that the expression contains only strings shown by characters " and the above functions.
Commands in Perse-script are case-insensitive. So to call substr function you can write SUBsTr(). But you can't print as the result "hElLo" instead of printing "Hello".
See the samples for more information.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line containing the correct expression. It is guaranteed that the total length of this expression does not exceed $ 10^{3} $ and that all the integers used in it are less than or equal to $ 100 $ by absolute value. The given string is non-empty.
All strings in the input which are placed between "s consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters only.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print in single line the resulting string. It is guaranteed that an answer exists and that the length of the answer does not exceed $ 10^{4} $ . It is guaranteed that the answer is non-empty.</div>
