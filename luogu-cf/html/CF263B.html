<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题意描述**
Vasya找到了一张写着坐标系的纸条。上面绘制着n个不同的方块。我们用1~n，这n个整数对这些方块进行编号。于是，它们被我们描述成是对角坐标分别为 (0,0) 与 (a[i],a[i]) 的正方形
现在，我们这样定义：如果某点位于某个正方形内部或其边界上，我们就称这个点属于这个正方形。
Vasya希望在坐标系找到这样一个点，（横纵坐标都为整数），使得在给出的n个的正方形中，它属于其中k个正方形。请你帮助Vasya找到这样一个符合题意的点。
**注意：**
1. 若有多解，择一输出即可
1. 若无解，输出“-1”（忽略引号）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has found a piece of paper with a coordinate system written on it. There are $ n $ distinct squares drawn in this coordinate system. Let's number the squares with integers from 1 to $ n $ . It turned out that points with coordinates $ (0,0) $ and $ (a_{i},a_{i}) $ are the opposite corners of the $ i $ -th square.
Vasya wants to find such integer point (with integer coordinates) of the plane, that belongs to exactly $ k $ drawn squares. We'll say that a point belongs to a square, if the point is located either inside the square, or on its boundary.
Help Vasya find a point that would meet the described limits.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=50) $ . The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .
It is guaranteed that all given squares are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print two space-separated integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (0<=x,y<=10^{9}) $ — the coordinates of the point that belongs to exactly $ k $ squares. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
If there is no answer, print "-1" (without the quotes).</div>
