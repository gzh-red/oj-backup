<h1>You Are Given a Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>```
有一棵n个节点的树
其中一个简单路径的集合被称为k合法当且仅当：
树的每个节点至多属于其中一条路径，且每条路径恰好包含k个点
对于k∈[1,n]，求出k合法路径集合的最多路径数
即：设k合法路径集合为S，求最大的|S|
```</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths $ k $ -valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly $ k $ vertices.
You are given a tree with $ n $ vertices. For each $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a $ k $ -valid set of simple paths.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 100\,000 $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Then following $ n - 1 $ lines describe the tree, each of them contains two integers $ v $ , $ u $ ( $ 1 \le v, u \le n $ ) — endpoints of the corresponding edge.
It is guaranteed, that the given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ numbers, the $ i $ -th of which is the maximum possible number of paths in an $ i $ -valid set of paths.</div>
