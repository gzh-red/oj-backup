<h1>Array Queries</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个序列，有q次询问，每次询问给定p和k，重复执行操作p=p+a[p]+k，直到p大于n，询问的答案为操作次数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> $ a $ is an array of $ n $ positive integers, all of which are not greater than $ n $ .
You have to process $ q $ queries to this array. Each query is represented by two numbers $ p $ and $ k $ . Several operations are performed in each query; each operation changes $ p $ to $ p+a_{p}+k $ . There operations are applied until $ p $ becomes greater than $ n $ . The answer to the query is the number of performed operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=100000) $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers — elements of $ a $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ for each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ).
The third line containts one integer $ q $ $ (1<=q<=100000) $ .
Then $ q $ lines follow. Each line contains the values of $ p $ and $ k $ for corresponding query $ (1<=p,k<=n) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers, $ i $ th integer must be equal to the answer to $ i $ th query.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider first example:
In first query after first operation $ p=3 $ , after second operation $ p=5 $ .
In next two queries $ p $ is greater than $ n $ after the first operation.</div>
