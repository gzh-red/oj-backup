<h1>Graph Decomposition</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**本题仅允许使用`kotlin`提交**
`NaCly_Fish`给了你一张有$n$个点$m$条边的无向图。
每一次你可以选择图中的一个简单环，并且删除这个环中的所有边。
对于给定的图，你需要回答是否可以经过若干次删除来将所有的边删掉。
你并不需要最小化操作次数，但你需要输出你的操作方式。
不保证一定有答案，也不保证没有重边和自环。
其中，环是指一条首尾都是同一个节点的路径，而简单环中的所有节点都只被这条路径覆盖了一次。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges.
Recall that a cycle is a path that starts and ends in the same vertex. A cycle in a graph is called simple if it contains each vertex (except the starting and ending one) no more than once (the starting and the ending one is contained always twice). Note that loops are considered to be simple cycles.
In one move you can choose any simple cycle in this graph and erase the edges corresponding to this cycle (corresponding vertices remain in the graph). It is allowed to erase the loop or two copies of the same edge (take a look at examples).
Your problem is to apply some sequence of moves to obtain the graph without edges. It is not necessary to minimize the number of cycles. If it is impossible, print "NO".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.
The next $ m $ lines contain edges of the graph. The $ i $ -th line contains the $ i $ -th edge $ x_i, y_i $ ( $ 1 \le x_i, y_i \le n $ ), where $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ are vertices connected by the $ i $ -th edge. The graph can contain loops or multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to decompose the given graph into simple cycles, print "NO" in the first line.
Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line print $ k $ — the number of simple cycles in the graph decomposition.
In the next $ k $ lines print cycles themselves. The $ j $ -th line should contain the $ j $ -th cycle. First, print $ c_j $ — the number of vertices in the $ j $ -th cycle. Then print the cycle as a sequence of vertices. All neighbouring (adjacent) vertices in the printed path should be connected by an edge that isn't contained in other cycles.</div>
