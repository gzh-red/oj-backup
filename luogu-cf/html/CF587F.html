<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Duff is mad at her friends. That's why she sometimes makes Malek to take candy from one of her friends for no reason!
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587F/7810ab2c67dc500a79551ee47d72814d41aa6aca.png)She has $ n $ friends. Her $ i $ -th friend's name is $ s_{i} $ (their names are not necessarily unique). $ q $ times, she asks Malek to take candy from her friends. She's angry, but also she acts with rules. When she wants to ask Malek to take candy from one of her friends, like $ k $ , she chooses two numbers $ l $ and $ r $ and tells Malek to take exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587F/76c0bb1ab4b98e1fa756a74b5b778f6b6c0af2ca.png) candies from him/her, where $ occur(t,s) $ is the number of occurrences of string $ t $ in $ s $ .
Malek is not able to calculate how many candies to take in each request from Duff. That's why she asked for your help. Please tell him how many candies to take in each request.</div>
