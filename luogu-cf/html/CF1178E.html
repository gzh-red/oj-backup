<h1>Archaeology</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>###### 给出一个由a,b,c三种字符组成的字符串，求这个字符串的一个子序列。
###### 要求：这个子序列是回文串，且其长度至少为原串的一半（向下取整）。（不要求子序列尽量短，只要符合要求即可。）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice bought a Congo Prime Video subscription and was watching a documentary on the archaeological findings from Factor's Island on Loch Katrine in Scotland. The archaeologists found a book whose age and origin are unknown. Perhaps Alice can make some sense of it?
The book contains a single string of characters "a", "b" and "c". It has been pointed out that no two consecutive characters are the same. It has also been conjectured that the string contains an unusually long subsequence that reads the same from both sides.
Help Alice verify this by finding such subsequence that contains at least half of the characters of the original string, rounded down. Note that you don't have to maximise the length of it.
A string $ a $ is a subsequence of a string $ b $ if $ a $ can be obtained from $ b $ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of a single string $ s $ ( $ 2 \leq |s| \leq 10^6 $ ). The string $ s $ consists only of characters "a", "b", "c". It is guaranteed that no two consecutive characters are equal.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a palindrome $ t $ that is a subsequence of $ s $ and $ |t| \geq \lfloor \frac{|s|}{2} \rfloor $ .
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them. You don't have to maximise the length of $ t $ .
If there are no solutions, output a string "IMPOSSIBLE" (quotes for clarity).</div>
