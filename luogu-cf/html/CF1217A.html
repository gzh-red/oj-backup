<h1>Creating a Character</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$T$组测试数据，每组测试数据有$str, int, exp$三个参数，可将$str, int$增加， 增加的总和严格等于$exp$， 求有多少种方案使得增加后$str > int$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You play your favourite game yet another time. You chose the character you didn't play before. It has $ str $ points of strength and $ int $ points of intelligence. Also, at start, the character has $ exp $ free experience points you can invest either in strength or in intelligence (by investing one point you can either raise strength by $ 1 $ or raise intelligence by $ 1 $ ).
Since you'd like to make some fun you want to create a jock character, so it has more strength than intelligence points (resulting strength is strictly greater than the resulting intelligence).
Calculate the number of different character builds you can create (for the purpose of replayability) if you must invest all free points. Two character builds are different if their strength and/or intellect are different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the single integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \le T \le 100 $ ) — the number of queries. Next $ T $ lines contain descriptions of queries — one per line.
This line contains three integers $ str $ , $ int $ and $ exp $ ( $ 1 \le str, int \le 10^8 $ , $ 0 \le exp \le 10^8 $ ) — the initial strength and intelligence of the character and the number of free points, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ T $ integers — one per query. For each query print the number of different character builds you can create.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query there are only three appropriate character builds: $ (str = 7, int = 5) $ , $ (8, 4) $ and $ (9, 3) $ . All other builds are either too smart or don't use all free points.
In the second query there is only one possible build: $ (2, 1) $ .
In the third query there are two appropriate builds: $ (7, 6) $ , $ (8, 5) $ .
In the fourth query all builds have too much brains.</div>
