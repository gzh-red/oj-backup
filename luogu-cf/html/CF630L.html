<h1>Cracking the Code</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题意简述
给出一个五位数
我们设这个这个五位数的各个数位上的数字分别为<first digit><second digit><third digit><fourth digit><fifth digit>
现在我们把这个数各个数位上的数字按如下方式排列成新的数：<first digit><third digit><fifth digit><fourth digit><second digit>
然后我们要求其五次幂的后五个数字
例如对于数字12345，重新排列后得到13542，五次幂为455 422 043 125 550 171 232，输出71232
### 输入格式：
一行，长度为5的正整数，没有前导零。
### 输出格式：
一行，5个数字，没有间隔符。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The protection of a popular program developed by one of IT City companies is organized the following way. After installation it outputs a random five digit number which should be sent in SMS to a particular phone number. In response an SMS activation code arrives.
A young hacker Vasya disassembled the program and found the algorithm that transforms the shown number into the activation code. Note: it is clear that Vasya is a law-abiding hacker, and made it for a noble purpose — to show the developer the imperfection of their protection.
The found algorithm looks the following way. At first the digits of the number are shuffled in the following order <first digit><third digit><fifth digit><fourth digit><second digit>. For example the shuffle of $ 12345 $ should lead to $ 13542 $ . On the second stage the number is raised to the fifth power. The result of the shuffle and exponentiation of the number $ 12345 $ is $ 455 422 043 125 550 171 232 $ . The answer is the $ 5 $ last digits of this result. For the number $ 12345 $ the answer should be $ 71232 $ .
Vasya is going to write a keygen program implementing this algorithm. Can you do the same?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains a positive integer five digit number for which the activation code should be found.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output exactly $ 5 $ digits without spaces between them — the found activation code of the program.</div>
