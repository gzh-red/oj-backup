<h1>Paths</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一张n个顶点的图，对于点i,j。如果gcd(i,j)!=1,则i到j有一条长度为1的无向边。令dis(i,j)表示从i到j的最短路，如果i无法到j，则dis(i,j)=0。求节点两两之间距离之和</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a positive integer $ n $ . Let's build a graph on vertices $ 1,2,...,n $ in such a way that there is an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ if and only if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF870F/c23ed97fe13a97ab9d4221da3ee57148bf19e74e.png). Let $ d(u,v) $ be the shortest distance between $ u $ and $ v $ , or $ 0 $ if there is no path between them. Compute the sum of values $ d(u,v) $ over all $ 1<=u<v<=n $ . The $ gcd $ (greatest common divisor) of two positive integers is the maximum positive integer that divides both of the integers.</div>

There are no paths between other pairs of vertices.
The total distance is $ 2+1+1+2+1+1=8 $ .</div>
