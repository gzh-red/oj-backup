<h1>Alex and Complicated Task</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After you have read all the problems, probably, you think Alex is genius person. That's true! One day he came up with the following task.
Given a sequence of integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . You are to find a longest sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{4m} $ , that satisfies the following conditions:
- $ b_{4k+1}=b_{4k+3} $ for all valid integer $ k $ ;
- $ b_{4k+2}=b_{4k+4} $ for all valid integer $ k $ ;
- sequence $ b $ is subsequence of $ a $ (not necessarily contiguous subsequence).
And finally... Alex had given this complicated task to George, and George gave it to you. Help George to cope with the task.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=5·10^{5}) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print a single integer $ 4m $ — the maximal possible length of required sequence $ b $ . In the second line print $ 4m $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{4m} $ , that is required sequence.
If there are multiple optimal answers you may print any of them.</div>
