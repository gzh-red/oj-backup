<h1>Perfect Squares</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一组有n个整数的数组a1,a2,…,an.找出这组数中的最大非完全平方数。
完全平方数是指有这样的一个数x,存在整数y,使得x=$y^2$.
### 输入格式
第一行输入一个单独的整数n(1<=n<=1000 )，n为该组数的数量。
接下来有n个整数，a1,a2,an(-10^6<=a<=10^6)
数据保证至少存在一个整数是非完全平方数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given an array $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of $ n $ integers, find the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square.
A number $ x $ is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer $ y $ such that $ x=y^{2} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{6}<=a_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that at least one element of the array is not a perfect square.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the largest number in the array which is not a perfect square. It is guaranteed that an answer always exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
4 2

</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>32
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, $ 4 $ is a perfect square, so the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square is $ 2 $ .</div>
