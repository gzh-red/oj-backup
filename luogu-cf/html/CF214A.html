<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
Furik "非常喜欢" 数学课, 所以他从不去上课, 不像 Rubik. 但是现在Furik想要得到一个好一点的数学成绩. 为此, 他的数学老师Ms. Ivanova给了他一个新任务. Furik一瞬间就搞定了. 你行吗?
给你一个如下的等式方程组:
![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF214A/62e1cfae0726c97a669dda13cb6a561eafa52412.png)你的任务是计算, 有多少组整数(a,b)(0<=a,b)满足这个方程组.
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
仅一行, 包含两个整数 n,m (1<=n,m<=1000) — 该方程组的参数. 由一个空格分隔.
## 输出格式：
输出答案, 仅一行.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Furik loves math lessons very much, so he doesn't attend them, unlike Rubik. But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?
You are given a system of equations:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF214A/62e1cfae0726c97a669dda13cb6a561eafa52412.png)You should count, how many there are pairs of integers $ (a,b) $ $ (0<=a,b) $ which satisfy the system.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line contains two integers $ n,m $ $ (1<=n,m<=1000) $ — the parameters of the system. The numbers on the line are separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line print the answer to the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>9 3
