<h1>Fedor and New Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After you had helped George and Alex to move in the dorm, they went to help their friend Fedor play a new computer game «Call of Soldiers 3».
The game has $ (m+1) $ players and $ n $ types of soldiers in total. Players «Call of Soldiers 3» are numbered form $ 1 $ to $ (m+1) $ . Types of soldiers are numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ . Each player has an army. Army of the $ i $ -th player can be described by non-negative integer $ x_{i} $ . Consider binary representation of $ x_{i} $ : if the $ j $ -th bit of number $ x_{i} $ equal to one, then the army of the $ i $ -th player has soldiers of the $ j $ -th type.
Fedor is the $ (m+1) $ -th player of the game. He assume that two players can become friends if their armies differ in at most $ k $ types of soldiers (in other words, binary representations of the corresponding numbers differ in at most $ k $ bits). Help Fedor and count how many players can become his friends.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ $ (1<=k<=n<=20; 1<=m<=1000) $ .
The $ i $ -th of the next $ (m+1) $ lines contains a single integer $ x_{i} $ $ (1<=x_{i}<=2^{n}-1) $ , that describes the $ i $ -th player's army. We remind you that Fedor is the $ (m+1) $ -th player.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of Fedor's potential friends.</div>
