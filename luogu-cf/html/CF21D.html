<h1>Traveling Graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个有n个顶点，m条边的带边权无向图，要求从顶点1开始经过每一条边至少一次最后回到起点1，要求走过的边权值总和最小。
注意：可能有重边和自环
输入:第一行n，m，之后m行每行一条无向边
输出:一个整数w，代表最小边权和，若无解则输出-1
Translated by 稀神探女</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given undirected weighted graph. Find the length of the shortest cycle which starts from the vertex 1 and passes throught all the edges at least once. Graph may contain multiply edges between a pair of vertices and loops (edges from the vertex to itself).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=15,0<=m<=2000 $ ), $ n $ is the amount of vertices, and $ m $ is the amount of edges. Following $ m $ lines contain edges as a triples $ x,y,w $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n,1<=w<=10000 $ ), $ x,y $ are edge endpoints, and $ w $ is the edge length.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output minimal cycle length or -1 if it doesn't exists.</div>
