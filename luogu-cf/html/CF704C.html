<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你$m$种布尔变量$x_i(1\le x \le m)$,和$n$个形如$(x_i)$或者是$(x_i\ |\ x_j)$的式子($\ |\ $表示逻辑或),每种$x_i$满足它的正常形式$x_i$以及取反形式$\overline{x_i}$在所有式子中出现次数之和$\le2$.现在问这$m$种布尔变量有多少种取值($true$或者$false$),满足这$n$个式子的异或和$=1$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Natalia Romanova is trying to test something on the new gun S.H.I.E.L.D gave her. In order to determine the result of the test, she needs to find the number of answers to a certain equation. The equation is of form:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF704C/1d8b978fb9a12b135427c0c260993d6889a8fc0c.png)
Where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF704C/7fca95146e6c9642c62830d4709435706988c675.png) represents logical OR and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF704C/4298d47c0191af3c0a3103f431751061bc7e2362.png) represents logical exclusive OR (XOR), and $ v_{i,j} $ are some boolean variables or their negations. Natalia calls the left side of the equation a XNF formula. Each statement in brackets is called a clause, and $ v_{i,j} $ are called literals.
In the equation Natalia has, the left side is actually a 2-XNF-2 containing variables $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{m} $ and their negations. An XNF formula is 2-XNF-2 if:
1. For each $ 1<=i<=n $ , $ k_{i}<=2 $ , i.e. the size of each clause doesn't exceed two.
2. Each variable occurs in the formula at most two times (with negation and without negation in total). Please note that it's possible that a variable occurs twice but its negation doesn't occur in any clause (or vice versa).
Natalia is given a formula of $ m $ variables, consisting of $ n $ clauses. Please, make sure to check the samples in order to properly understand how the formula looks like.
Natalia is more into fight than theory, so she asked you to tell her the number of answers to this equation. More precisely, you need to find the number of ways to set $ x_{1},...,x_{m} $ with $ true $ and $ false $ (out of total of $ 2^{m} $ ways) so that the equation is satisfied. Since this number can be extremely large, you need to print the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
Please, note that some variable may appear twice in one clause, or not appear in the equation at all (but still, setting it to $ false $ or $ true $ gives different ways to set variables).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=100000 $ ) — the number of clauses and the number of variables respectively.
The next $ n $ lines contain the formula. The $ i $ -th of them starts with an integer $ k_{i} $ — the number of literals in the $ i $ -th clause. It is followed by $ k_{i} $ non-zero integers $ a_{i,1},...,a_{i,ki} $ . If $ a_{i,j}&gt;0 $ then $ v_{i,j} $ is $ x_{ai,j} $ otherwise it's negation of $ x_{-ai,j} $ ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=2 $ , $ -m<=a_{i,j}<=m $ , $ a_{i,j}≠0 $ ).</div>
