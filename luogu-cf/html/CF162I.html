<h1>Truncatable primes【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A truncatable prime is a prime number which contains no zeros in decimal notation and all its suffixes are primes. 1 is considered to be not a prime.
You are given a positive integer $ n $ . Figure out whether it is a truncatable prime.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{7} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES" if $ n $ is a truncatable prime. Output "NO" otherwise. Quotes for clarity only.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>19
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9137
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample 19 is a prime but its suffix 9 is not.
In the second sample 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all primes, so 9137 is a truncatable prime.</div>
