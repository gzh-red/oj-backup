<h1>The Holmes Children</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义函数$f$.
$f(1)=1,f(n)=\sum_{i=1 \to n-1}[gcd(i,n-i)=1].$
定义函数$g$.
$g(n)=\sum_{d|n}f(\frac{n}{d})$.
定义函数$F_k(n)$.
$F_k(n)=f(g(n))$,当且仅当$k=1$.
$F_k(n)=g(F_{k-1}(n))$,当且仅当$k>1,k$为偶数.
$F_k(n)=f(F_{k-1}(n))$,当且仅当$k>1,k$为奇数.
给定$n,k$，求$F_k(n)$.
$n,k<=10^{12}$.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Holmes children are fighting over who amongst them is the cleverest.
Mycroft asked Sherlock and Eurus to find value of $ f(n) $ , where $ f(1)=1 $ and for $ n>=2 $ , $ f(n) $ is the number of distinct ordered positive integer pairs $ (x,y) $ that satisfy $ x+y=n $ and $ gcd(x,y)=1 $ . The integer $ gcd(a,b) $ is the greatest common divisor of $ a $ and $ b $ .
Sherlock said that solving this was child's play and asked Mycroft to instead get the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF776E/1a109f1de0f9bab1129f477d3f3eae085caca16a.png). Summation is done over all positive integers $ d $ that divide $ n $ .
Eurus was quietly observing all this and finally came up with her problem to astonish both Sherlock and Mycroft.
She defined a $ k $ -composite function $ F_{k}(n) $ recursively as follows:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF776E/bd985db890d6882c9f46cc152e6a148e4e80dbfa.png)She wants them to tell the value of $ F_{k}(n) $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line of input contains two space separated integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{12} $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{12} $ ) indicating that Eurus asks Sherlock and Mycroft to find the value of $ F_{k}(n) $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the value of $ F_{k}(n) $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case, there are $ 6 $ distinct ordered pairs $ (1,6) $ , $ (2,5) $ , $ (3,4) $ , $ (4,3) $ , $ (5,2) $ and $ (6,1) $ satisfying $ x+y=7 $ and $ gcd(x,y)=1 $ . Hence, $ f(7)=6 $ . So, $ F_{1}(7)=f(g(7))=f(f(7)+f(1))=f(6+1)=f(7)=6 $ .</div>
