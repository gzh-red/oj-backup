<h1>Wet Shark and Odd and Even</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入N个正整数选择其中的几个，组成最大的偶数（如果不选输出0）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today, Wet Shark is given $ n $ integers. Using any of these integers no more than once, Wet Shark wants to get maximum possible even (divisible by $ 2 $ ) sum. Please, calculate this value for Wet Shark.
Note, that if Wet Shark uses no integers from the $ n $ integers, the sum is an even integer $ 0 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer, $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ). The next line contains $ n $ space separated integers given to Wet Shark. Each of these integers is in range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained if we use some of the given integers.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
1 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3999999996</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, we can simply take all three integers for a total sum of $ 6 $ .
In the second sample Wet Shark should take any four out of five integers $ 999999999 $ .</div>
