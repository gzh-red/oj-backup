<h1>Array</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got an array $ a $ , consisting of $ n $ integers: $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Your task is to find a minimal by inclusion segment $ [l,r] $ $ (1<=l<=r<=n) $ such, that among numbers $ a_{l}, a_{l+1}, ..., a_{r} $ there are exactly $ k $ distinct numbers.
Segment $ [l,r] $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n; $ $ l,r $ are integers) of length $ m=r-l+1 $ , satisfying the given property, is called minimal by inclusion, if there is no segment $ [x,y] $ satisfying the property and less then $ m $ in length, such that $ 1<=l<=x<=y<=r<=n $ . Note that the segment $ [l,r] $ doesn't have to be minimal in length among all segments, satisfying the given property.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers: $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=10^{5} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ — elements of the array $ a $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a space-separated pair of integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) such, that the segment $ [l,r] $ is the answer to the problem. If the sought segment does not exist, print "-1 -1" without the quotes. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample among numbers $ a_{1} $ and $ a_{2} $ there are exactly two distinct numbers.
In the second sample segment $ [2,5] $ is a minimal by inclusion segment with three distinct numbers, but it is not minimal in length among such segments.
In the third sample there is no segment with four distinct numbers.</div>
