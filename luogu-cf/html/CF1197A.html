<h1>DIY Wooden Ladder</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**PS:此翻译对原题意进行了修改。**
有$n$个数，依次为$a_1,a_2,a_3...a_n$。
然后你可以从中选出$k+2$个数（$k$为任意正整数）。
对于这$k+2$个数字，要满足第二大的数字至少比$k$大$1$。
问最大的符合条件的$k$为多少。
## 输入格式
本题由$T$组数据构成（$1 \le T \le 100$）
每一组数据，第一行会给出$n$（$2 \le n \le 10^5$）
第二行有$n$个数字，第$i$个数字表示$a_i$（$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$）
## 输出格式
对于每一组数据，输出最大的符合条件的$k$。
### 特别的，如果没有符合条件的$k$，则输出$0$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's denote a $ k $ -step ladder as the following structure: exactly $ k + 2 $ wooden planks, of which
- two planks of length at least $ k+1 $ — the base of the ladder;
- $ k $ planks of length at least $ 1 $ — the steps of the ladder;
Note that neither the base planks, nor the steps planks are required to be equal.
For example, ladders $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ are correct $ 2 $ -step ladders and ladder $ 2 $ is a correct $ 1 $ -step ladder. On the first picture the lengths of planks are $ [3, 3] $ for the base and $ [1] $ for the step. On the second picture lengths are $ [3, 3] $ for the base and $ [2] $ for the step. On the third picture lengths are $ [3, 4] $ for the base and $ [2, 3] $ for the steps.

You don't have a saw, so you can't cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised "ladder" from the planks.
The question is: what is the maximum number $ k $ such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a $ k $ -step ladder using them?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \le T \le 100 $ ) — the number of queries. The queries are independent.
Each query consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of planks you have.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^5 $ ) — the lengths of the corresponding planks.
It's guaranteed that the total number of planks from all queries doesn't exceed $ 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ T $ integers — one per query. The $ i $ -th integer is the maximum number $ k $ , such that you can choose some subset of the planks given in the $ i $ -th query and assemble a $ k $ -step ladder using them.
Print $ 0 $ if you can't make even $ 1 $ -step ladder from the given set of planks.</div>
