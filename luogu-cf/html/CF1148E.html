<h1>Earth Wind and Fire</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$n$个石头，第$i$个石头的位置为$s_i$(同一位置可以有多个石头)，每一次操作可以选择两个石头$i$和$j$,满足$s_i\le s_j$，并选择一个参数$d$满足$0\le 2d\le s_j-s_i$，将$s_i$修改为$s_i+d$，将$s_j$修改为$s_j-d$。
问能否通过一系列操作将$n$个石头的位置修改为$t_1,t_2,t_3,...,t_n$(顺序任意)，如果不能输出"NO"(不含引号)，如果能在第一行输出"YES"(不含引号)，第二行输出操作步数$m$($0\le m\le 5\times n$)，接下来$m$行依次输出每一个操作$i\ j\ d$。
**你不需要最小化操作步数**</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ stones arranged on an axis. Initially the $ i $ -th stone is located at the coordinate $ s_i $ . There may be more than one stone in a single place.
You can perform zero or more operations of the following type:
- take two stones with indices $ i $ and $ j $ so that $ s_i \leq s_j $ , choose an integer $ d $ ( $ 0 \leq 2 \cdot d \leq s_j - s_i $ ), and replace the coordinate $ s_i $ with $ (s_i + d) $ and replace coordinate $ s_j $ with $ (s_j - d) $ . In other words, draw stones closer to each other.
You want to move the stones so that they are located at positions $ t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n $ . The order of the stones is not important — you just want for the multiset of the stones resulting positions to be the same as the multiset of $ t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n $ .
Detect whether it is possible to move the stones this way, and if yes, construct a way to do so. You don't need to minimize the number of moves.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) – the number of stones.
The second line contains integers $ s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n $ ( $ 1 \le s_i \le 10^9 $ ) — the initial positions of the stones.
The second line contains integers $ t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n $ ( $ 1 \le t_i \le 10^9 $ ) — the target positions of the stones.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to move the stones this way, print "NO".
Otherwise, on the first line print "YES", on the second line print the number of operations $ m $ ( $ 0 \le m \le 5 \cdot n $ ) required. You don't have to minimize the number of operations.
Then print $ m $ lines, each containing integers $ i, j, d $ ( $ 1 \le i, j \le n $ , $ s_i \le s_j $ , $ 0 \leq 2 \cdot d \leq s_j - s_i $ ), defining the operations.
One can show that if an answer exists, there is an answer requiring no more than $ 5 \cdot n $ operations.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the first example.
- After the first move the locations of stones is $ [2, 2, 6, 5, 9] $ .
- After the second move the locations of stones is $ [2, 3, 5, 5, 9] $ .
- After the third move the locations of stones is $ [2, 5, 5, 5, 7] $ .
- After the last move the locations of stones is $ [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] $ .</div>
