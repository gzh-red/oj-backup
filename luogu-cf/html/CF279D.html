<h1>The Minimum Number of Variables</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got a positive integer sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . All numbers in the sequence are distinct. Let's fix the set of variables $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ . Initially each variable $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=i<=m) $ contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of $ n $ operations.
The first operation is assigning the value of $ a_{1} $ to some variable $ b_{x} $ $ (1<=x<=m) $ . Each of the following $ n-1 $ operations is assigning to some variable $ b_{y} $ the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables $ b_{i} $ and $ b_{j} $ $ (1<=i,j,y<=m) $ . At that, the value that is assigned on the $ t $ -th operation, must equal $ a_{t} $ . For each operation numbers $ y,i,j $ are chosen anew.
Your task is to find the minimum number of variables $ m $ , such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=23) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{k}<=10^{9}) $ .
It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a single number — the minimum number of variables $ m $ , such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.
If you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any $ m $ , print -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, you can use two variables $ b_{1} $ and $ b_{2} $ to perform the following sequence of operations.
1. $ b_{1} $ := $ 1 $ ;
2. $ b_{2} $ := $ b_{1}+b_{1} $ ;
3. $ b_{1} $ := $ b_{1}+b_{2} $ ;
4. $ b_{1} $ := $ b_{1}+b_{1} $ ;
5. $ b_{1} $ := $ b_{1}+b_{2} $ .</div>
