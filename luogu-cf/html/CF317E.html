<h1>Princess and Her Shadow</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>平面直角坐标系上，有一个公主和她的影子，还有$ m $ 棵树，公主在$ (v_x,v_y) $ ,影子在$ (s_x,s_y) $ 。
公主要去追影子。
公主向右走，影子就会向右走；公主向左走，影子就会向左走；公主向上走，影子就会向上走；公主向下走，影子就会向下走。
如果影子前进的方向是一棵树，影子就不会动。公主不能撞树。
求一组公主的行动方案，让公主抓到影子，要求方案长度不能超过$ 10^6 $ 。若无解，输出-1
输入格式：
第一行：$ v_x,v_y,s_x,s_y,m $
接下来$ m $ 个数表示树的坐标 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Princess Vlada enjoys springing in the meadows and walking in the forest. One day — wonderful, sunny day — during her walk Princess found out with astonishment that her shadow was missing! "Blimey!", — she thought and started her search of the shadow in the forest.
Normally the Shadow is too lazy and simply sleeps under the Princess. But at this terrifically hot summer day she got bored of such a dull life, so she decided to play with Vlada.
The forest, where our characters entertain themselves, may be represented as a set of integer cells in the plane, where the Shadow and the Princess can move only up, down, left and right by $ 1 $ . Some cells (as it happens in decent forests) are occupied by trees. The Shadow and the Princess are not allowed to enter a cell occupied by a tree. Unfortunately, these are the hard times for the forest, so there are very few trees growing here...
At first the Princess was walking within the cell ( $ v_{x} $ , $ v_{y} $ ), while the Shadow hid from the Princess in the cell ( $ s_{x} $ , $ s_{y} $ ). The Princess, The Shadow and the trees are located in the different cells.
The Shadow is playing with the Princess. As soon as the Princess moves by $ 1 $ in some direction, the Shadow simultaneously flies by $ 1 $ in the same direction, if it is possible (if the cell to fly to is not occupied by some tree); otherwise, the Shadow doesn't move. The Shadow is very shadowy, so our characters do not interfere with each other.
We say that the Shadow is caught by the Princess if after some move both of them are located in the same cell. Vlada managed to catch her Shadow! Can you?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input contains the coordinates of the characters $ v_{x} $ , $ v_{y} $ , $ s_{x} $ , $ s_{y} $ and the number of trees $ m $ ( $ 0<=m<=400 $ ). The following $ m $ lines contain the coordinates of the trees.
All the coordinates are integers between -100 and 100, inclusive. The Princess, The Shadow and the trees are located in the different cells.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible for the Princess to catch the Shadow, print "-1" (without quotes).
Otherwise print a sequence of characters "L", "R", "D", "U", corresponding to the Princess's moves, following which she will be able to catch the Shadow at some turn (L — move to the left, R — to the right, U — up, D — down; axis $ x $ is directed to the right, $ y $ — up).
The number of characters (that is, the number of moves) must not exceed $ 10^{6} $ . All the Princess's moves should be correct, that is must not lead to the cell where a tree grows. It is allowed for the Princess and the Shadow to occupy the same cell before the last turn.</div>
