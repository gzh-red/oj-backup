<h1>XOR on Segment</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
给定一个长为$n$($n<=10^5$)的数组
数组里的数不超过$10^6$
有两种操作：
1:求$sum[l,r]$;
2:对$[l,r]$中的所有数和$x$异或</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got an array $ a $ , consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . You are allowed to perform two operations on this array:
1. Calculate the sum of current array elements on the segment $ [l,r] $ , that is, count value $ a_{l}+a_{l+1}+...+a_{r} $ .
2. Apply the xor operation with a given number $ x $ to each array element on the segment $ [l,r] $ , that is, execute ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF242E/a6ed6800239445c652bf1618450a09b2fce8b86d.png). This operation changes exactly $ r-l+1 $ array elements.
Expression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF242E/a0b0fe9e9428287337c0277ea02ca07fcf0a01a7.png) means applying bitwise xor operation to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . The given operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example in language C++ and Java it is marked as "^", in Pascal — as "xor".
You've got a list of $ m $ operations of the indicated type. Your task is to perform all given operations, for each sum query you should print the result you get.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) — the original array.
The third line contains integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=5·10^{4} $ ) — the number of operations with the array. The $ i $ -th of the following $ m $ lines first contains an integer $ t_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=2 $ ) — the type of the $ i $ -th query. If $ t_{i}=1 $ , then this is the query of the sum, if $ t_{i}=2 $ , then this is the query to change array elements. If the $ i $ -th operation is of type $ 1 $ , then next follow two integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ). If the $ i $ -th operation is of type $ 2 $ , then next follow three integers $ l_{i},r_{i},x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n,1<=x_{i}<=10^{6} $ ). The numbers on the lines are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of type $ 1 $ print in a single line the sum of numbers on the given segment. Print the answers to the queries in the order in which the queries go in the input.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams, or the %I64d specifier.</div>
