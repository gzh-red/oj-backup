<h1>Dancing Lessons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个人在上舞蹈课，每个人都有相应的舞蹈技能。记录男女在一起直到结尾，然后选出男女差值最小的一对，如果有多对，就从左往右输出，选出后剩下的成员紧密排在一起，直到不能找到男女搭配。问：输出组合对数，并且每队成员最初时的位置标号。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ people taking dancing lessons. Every person is characterized by his/her dancing skill $ a_{i} $ . At the beginning of the lesson they line up from left to right. While there is at least one couple of a boy and a girl in the line, the following process is repeated: the boy and girl who stand next to each other, having the minimal difference in dancing skills start to dance. If there are several such couples, the one first from the left starts to dance. After a couple leaves to dance, the line closes again, i.e. as a result the line is always continuous. The difference in dancing skills is understood as the absolute value of difference of $ a_{i} $ variable. Your task is to find out what pairs and in what order will start dancing.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of people. The next line contains $ n $ symbols B or G without spaces. B stands for a boy, G stands for a girl. The third line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{7} $ ) — the dancing skill. People are specified from left to right in the order in which they lined up.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the resulting number of couples $ k $ . Then print $ k $ lines containing two numerals each — the numbers of people forming the couple. The people are numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. When a couple leaves to dance you shouldn't renumber the people. The numbers in one couple should be sorted in the increasing order. Print the couples in the order in which they leave to dance.</div>
