<h1>Slightly Decreasing Permutations</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Permutation $ p $ is an ordered set of integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ , consisting of $ n $ distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed $ n $ . We'll denote the $ i $ -th element of permutation $ p $ as $ p_{i} $ . We'll call number $ n $ the size or the length of permutation $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ .
The decreasing coefficient of permutation $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ is the number of such $ i\ (1<=i&lt;n) $ , that $ p_{i}&gt;p_{i+1} $ .
You have numbers $ n $ and $ k $ . Your task is to print the permutation of length $ n $ with decreasing coefficient $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two space-separated integers: $ n,k\ (1<=n<=10^{5},0<=k&lt;n) $ — the permutation length and the decreasing coefficient.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print $ n $ space-separated integers: $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ — the permutation of length $ n $ with decreasing coefficient $ k $ .
If there are several permutations that meet this condition, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the permutation with the sought parameters exists.</div>
