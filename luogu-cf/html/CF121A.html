<h1>Lucky Sum</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Petya喜欢Lucky Number。仅含有数字$4$和$7$的数字是一个Lucky Number。
规定$next(x)$等于最小的大于等于$x$的Lucky Number。现在Petya想知道$next(l)+next(l+1)+...+next(r-1)+next(r)$的值是多少。$(1<=l<=r<=10^{9})$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Let $ next(x) $ be the minimum lucky number which is larger than or equals $ x $ . Petya is interested what is the value of the expression $ next(l)+next(l+1)+...+next(r-1)+next(r) $ . Help him solve this problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=10^{9} $ ) — the left and right interval limits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print the only number — the sum $ next(l)+next(l+1)+...+next(r-1)+next(r) $ .
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>33
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>7 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>7
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample: $ next(2)+next(3)+next(4)+next(5)+next(6)+next(7)=4+4+4+7+7+7=33 $
In the second sample: $ next(7)=7 $</div>
