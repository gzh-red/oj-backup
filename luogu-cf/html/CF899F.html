<h1>Letters Removing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>长度为n的串，m次操作，删除一段区间内的所有为c的字符，输出删除完毕后的字符串。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya has a string of length $ n $ consisting of small and large English letters and digits.
He performs $ m $ operations. Each operation is described with two integers $ l $ and $ r $ and a character $ c $ : Petya removes from the string all characters $ c $ on positions between $ l $ and $ r $ , inclusive. It's obvious that the length of the string remains the same or decreases after each operation.
Find how the string will look like after Petya performs all $ m $ operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first string contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the length of the string and the number of operations.
The second line contains the string of length $ n $ , consisting of small and large English letters and digits. Positions in the string are enumerated from $ 1 $ .
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r $ ), followed by a character $ c $ , which is a small or large English letter or a digit. This line describes one operation. It is guaranteed that $ r $ doesn't exceed the length of the string $ s $ before current operation.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the string Petya will obtain after performing all $ m $ operations. If the strings becomes empty after all operations, print an empty line.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example during the first operation both letters 'a' are removed, so the string becomes "bc". During the second operation the letter 'c' (on the second position) is removed, and the string becomes "b".
In the second example during the first operation Petya removes '0' from the second position. After that the string becomes "Az". During the second operations the string doesn't change.</div>
