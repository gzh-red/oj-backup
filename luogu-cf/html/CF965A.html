<h1>Paper Airplanes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一张纸能做s个纸飞机，每个人要做n个纸飞机,团队里有k个人,一包纸里有p张。问你最少买多少包纸，可以完成要求。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>To make a paper airplane, one has to use a rectangular piece of paper. From a sheet of standard size you can make $ s $ airplanes.
A group of $ k $ people decided to make $ n $ airplanes each. They are going to buy several packs of paper, each of them containing $ p $ sheets, and then distribute the sheets between the people. Each person should have enough sheets to make $ n $ airplanes. How many packs should they buy?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains four integers $ k $ , $ n $ , $ s $ , $ p $ ( $ 1 \le k, n, s, p \le 10^4 $ ) — the number of people, the number of airplanes each should make, the number of airplanes that can be made using one sheet and the number of sheets in one pack, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum number of packs they should buy.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample they have to buy $ 4 $ packs of paper: there will be $ 12 $ sheets in total, and giving $ 2 $ sheets to each person is enough to suit everyone's needs.
In the second sample they have to buy a pack for each person as they can't share sheets.</div>
