<h1>PolandBall and Hypothesis</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于一个数n(1≤n≤1000)，输出一个m，使得n·m+1不是质数且1≤m≤1000。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer $ n $ that for each positive integer $ m $ number $ n·m+1 $ is a prime number".
Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only number in the input is $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output such $ m $ that $ n·m+1 $ is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable $ m $ such that $ 1<=m<=10^{3} $ . It is guaranteed the the answer exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than $ 1 $ that has no positive divisors other than $ 1 $ and itself.
For the first sample testcase, $ 3·1+1=4 $ . We can output $ 1 $ .
In the second sample testcase, $ 4·1+1=5 $ . We cannot output $ 1 $ because $ 5 $ is prime. However, $ m=2 $ is okay since $ 4·2+1=9 $ , which is not a prime number.</div>
