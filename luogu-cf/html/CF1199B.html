<h1>Water Lily</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在有一朵长在水中的莲花，它露出水面的长度为H厘米（不包括花朵）
有人把它拽了L 厘米，使得茎秆部分恰好完全浸没于水中
现在给你H和L，请求水的深度</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $ H $ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $ L $ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1199B/42f6cea9c2bcade7ac8750d98129857158bca8c3.png)Suppose that the lily grows at some point $ A $ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $ A $ . Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $ A $ , i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $ A $ ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two integers $ H $ and $ L $ ( $ 1 \le H < L \le 10^{6} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the depth of the lake at point $ A $ . The absolute or relative error should not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .
Formally, let your answer be $ A $ , and the jury's answer be $ B $ . Your answer is accepted if and only if $ \frac{|A - B|}{\max{(1, |B|)}} \le 10^{-6} $ .</div>
