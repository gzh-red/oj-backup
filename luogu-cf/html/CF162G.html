<h1>Non-decimal sum【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array of integers written in base $ radix $ . Calculate their sum and output it written in the same base.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10 $ ) — the size of the array. The second line contains an integer $ radix $ ( $ 2<=radix<=36 $ ) — the base of the numeral system used. Next $ n $ lines contain the elements of the array, one per line.
Each element is a non-negative integer written in $ radix $ -based notation, possibly with leading zeros, which contains between 1 and 5 digits, inclusive. The digits of the notation will be 0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, ..., Z in the given order.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the sum of array elements in $ radix $ -based notation. Use the same format as in the input.</div>
