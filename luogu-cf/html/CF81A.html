<h1>Plug-in</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个仅由小写字母构成的字符串（字符串长度小于等于200000），求删除这个字符串里所有重复字串后的结果。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp thinks about the meaning of life very often. He does this constantly, even when typing in the editor. Every time he starts brooding he can no longer fully concentrate and repeatedly presses the keys that need to be pressed only once. For example, instead of the phrase "how are you" he can type "hhoow aaaare yyoouu".
Polycarp decided to automate the process of correcting such errors. He decided to write a plug-in to the text editor that will remove pairs of identical consecutive letters (if there are any in the text). Of course, this is not exactly what Polycarp needs, but he's got to start from something!
Help Polycarp and write the main plug-in module. Your program should remove from a string all pairs of identical letters, which are consecutive. If after the removal there appear new pairs, the program should remove them as well. Technically, its work should be equivalent to the following: while the string contains a pair of consecutive identical letters, the pair should be deleted. Note that deleting of the consecutive identical letters can be done in any order, as any order leads to the same result.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data consists of a single line to be processed. The length of the line is from $ 1 $ to $ 2·10^{5} $ characters inclusive. The string contains only lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the given string after it is processed. It is guaranteed that the result will contain at least one character.</div>
