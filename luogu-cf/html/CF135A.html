<h1>Replacement</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个元素个数为n的数组，第$i$个元素为$a[i]$，$ 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9$
求用$1$~$10^9$之间的数（除了本身）替换其中一个元素后剩下和最小，按非降序输出数组</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Petya very much likes arrays consisting of $ n $ integers, where each of them is in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive. Recently he has received one such array as a gift from his mother. Petya didn't like it at once. He decided to choose exactly one element from the array and replace it with another integer that also lies in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive. It is not allowed to replace a number with itself or to change no number at all.
After the replacement Petya sorted the array by the numbers' non-decreasing. Now he wants to know for each position: what minimum number could occupy it after the replacement and the sorting.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ), which represents how many numbers the array has. The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers — the array's description. All elements of the array lie in the range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{9} $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ space-separated integers — the minimum possible values of each array element after one replacement and the sorting are performed.</div>
