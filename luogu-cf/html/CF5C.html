<h1>Longest Regular Bracket Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个括号序列，求出最长合法子串和它的数量。
合法的定义：这个序列中左右括号匹配</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is yet another problem dealing with regular bracket sequences.
We should remind you that a bracket sequence is called regular, if by inserting «+» and «1» into it we can get a correct mathematical expression. For example, sequences «(())()», «()» and «(()(()))» are regular, while «)(», «(()» and «(()))(» are not.
You are given a string of «(» and «)» characters. You are to find its longest substring that is a regular bracket sequence. You are to find the number of such substrings as well.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains a non-empty string, consisting of «(» and «)» characters. Its length does not exceed $ 10^{6} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the length of the longest substring that is a regular bracket sequence, and the number of such substrings. If there are no such substrings, write the only line containing "0 1".</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
