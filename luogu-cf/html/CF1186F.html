<h1>Vus the Cossack and a Graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n$个节点，$m$条边的无向图，记$d_i$为第$i$个点的度。
一个点的度是这个点上连的边数。
$Vus$需要保留$\lceil\frac{n+m}{2}\rceil$条边，并保证对于任意一个点$i$满足$f_i \geq \lceil \frac{d_i}{2}\rceil$其中$f_i$表示$i$点在保留的图中的度。
求$Vus$需要保留哪些边。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vus the Cossack has a simple graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. Let $ d_i $ be a degree of the $ i $ -th vertex. Recall that a degree of the $ i $ -th vertex is the number of conected edges to the $ i $ -th vertex.
He needs to remain not more than $ \lceil \frac{n+m}{2} \rceil $ edges. Let $ f_i $ be the degree of the $ i $ -th vertex after removing. He needs to delete them in such way so that $ \lceil \frac{d_i}{2} \rceil \leq f_i $ for each $ i $ . In other words, the degree of each vertex should not be reduced more than twice.
Help Vus to remain the needed edges!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^6 $ , $ 0 \leq m \leq 10^6 $ ) — the number of vertices and edges respectively.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n $ ) — vertices between which there is an edge.
It is guaranteed that the graph does not have loops and multiple edges.
It is possible to show that the answer always exists.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, print one integer $ k $ ( $ 0 \leq k \leq \lceil \frac{n+m}{2} \rceil $ ) — the number of edges which you need to remain.
In each of the next $ k $ lines, print two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n $ ) — the vertices, the edge between which, you need to remain. You can not print the same edge more than once.</div>
