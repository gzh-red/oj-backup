<h1>DZY Loves Chemistry</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>DZY热爱化学.他有n种物质,其中m对会反应.他把它们一种一种倒到烧杯里.有一个危险值,一开始等于1.如果一种物质倒到烧杯里之后至少有一种物质能和它反应,则危险值乘以二;否则危险值不变.求所有物质倒到烧杯里之后最大的危险值.
By @Fuko_Ibuki </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>DZY loves chemistry, and he enjoys mixing chemicals.
DZY has $ n $ chemicals, and $ m $ pairs of them will react. He wants to pour these chemicals into a test tube, and he needs to pour them in one by one, in any order.
Let's consider the danger of a test tube. Danger of an empty test tube is $ 1 $ . And every time when DZY pours a chemical, if there are already one or more chemicals in the test tube that can react with it, the danger of the test tube will be multiplied by $ 2 $ . Otherwise the danger remains as it is.
Find the maximum possible danger after pouring all the chemicals one by one in optimal order.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF445B/04c5ea027a40d7547891712e7f413f407f9053ef.png).
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ $ (1<=x_{i}<y_{i}<=n) $ . These integers mean that the chemical $ x_{i} $ will react with the chemical $ y_{i} $ . Each pair of chemicals will appear at most once in the input. Consider all the chemicals numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in some order.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible danger.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there's only one way to pour, and the danger won't increase.
In the second sample, no matter we pour the $ 1 $ st chemical first, or pour the $ 2 $ nd chemical first, the answer is always $ 2 $ .
In the third sample, there are four ways to achieve the maximum possible danger: 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 1-2-3 and 3-2-1 (that is the numbers of the chemicals in order of pouring).</div>
