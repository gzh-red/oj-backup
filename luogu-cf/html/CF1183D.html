<h1>Candy Box (easy version)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>本题是G题的一个子问题。
你有$n$块糖果，第$i$块糖果的种类是$a_i$。
你想选出来若干块糖果送给别人。你选出来的糖果需要满足任意两种糖果的数量都不能相等。
求你最多能够选出来多少块糖果。
你需要回答$q$组询问。
$\text{——by wucstdio}$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This problem is actually a subproblem of problem G from the same contest.
There are $ n $ candies in a candy box. The type of the $ i $ -th candy is $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le n $ ).
You have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i. e. for example, a gift having two candies of type $ 1 $ and two candies of type $ 2 $ is bad).
It is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.
Your task is to find out the maximum possible size of the single gift you can prepare using the candies you have.
You have to answer $ q $ independent queries.
If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of queries. Each query is represented by two lines.
The first line of each query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of candies.
The second line of each query contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le n $ ), where $ a_i $ is the type of the $ i $ -th candy in the box.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all queries does not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print one integer — the maximum possible size of the single gift you can compose using candies you got in this query with the restriction described in the problem statement.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query, you can prepare a gift with two candies of type $ 8 $ and one candy of type $ 5 $ , totalling to $ 3 $ candies.
Note that this is not the only possible solution — taking two candies of type $ 4 $ and one candy of type $ 6 $ is also valid.</div>
