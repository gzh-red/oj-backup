<h1>Acyclic Organic Compounds</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree $ T $ with $ n $ vertices (numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ ) and a letter in each vertex. The tree is rooted at vertex $ 1 $ .
Let's look at the subtree $ T_{v} $ of some vertex $ v $ . It is possible to read a string along each simple path starting at $ v $ and ending at some vertex in $ T_{v} $ (possibly $ v $ itself). Let's denote the number of distinct strings which can be read this way as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/a0c9096effba09473c4b51e3186b592318344485.png).
Also, there's a number $ c_{v} $ assigned to each vertex $ v $ . We are interested in vertices with the maximum value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/c561564d7b2aed4877e755dc8d366f0ff87cf302.png).
You should compute two statistics: the maximum value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/c561564d7b2aed4877e755dc8d366f0ff87cf302.png) and the number of vertices $ v $ with the maximum ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/c561564d7b2aed4877e755dc8d366f0ff87cf302.png).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=300000 $ ) — the number of vertices of the tree.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ c_{i} $ ( $ 0<=c_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).
The third line contains a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase English letters — the $ i $ -th character of this string is the letter in vertex $ i $ .
The following $ n-1 $ lines describe the tree $ T $ . Each of them contains two space-separated integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ ) indicating an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ .
It's guaranteed that the input will describe a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two lines.
On the first line, print ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/ab594599a15dce04b620c4b306a1a124f3c93d49.png) over all $ 1<=i<=n $ .
On the second line, print the number of vertices $ v $ for which ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF601D/f0eef52a01ab9da1eb6f064715fdae90a5a11537.png).</div>
