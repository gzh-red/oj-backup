<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题意
NaCly_Fish 来到机房，他要出毒瘤题。
他用一些 $1\times 1 \times 1$ 的积木搭了一个三维作品，我们可以用一个 $n\times m$ 二维矩阵描述它，$h_{i,j}$ 表示 $(i,j)$位置 竖着摆的方块个数。
但 NaCly_Fish 是毒瘤，所以他不给你任何 $h_{i,j}$，只给你前视图，左视图，俯视图。
前视图是一个长度为 $m$ 的序列，其中$a_i$表示
$\max_{1\le j\le n} \{h_{j,i}\}$
左视图是一个长度为 $n$ 的序列，定义差不多
俯视图是一个二维矩阵，$t_{i,j}$ 表示 $(i,j)$ 位置是否放了格子 $(t_{i,j}=0,1)$
你需要输出任意一种满足限制的方案。
### 输入
第一行 $n,m,h(1\le n,m,h\le 100)$，$h$ 是最大高度
第二行 $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_m (0\le a_i\le h)$，描述前视图
第三行 $b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_n (0\le b_i\le h)$，描述左视图。
接下来一个 $n\times m$ 01矩阵，描述俯视图
### 输出

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Luckily, Serval got onto the right bus, and he came to the kindergarten on time. After coming to kindergarten, he found the toy bricks very funny.
He has a special interest to create difficult problems for others to solve. This time, with many $ 1 \times 1 \times 1 $ toy bricks, he builds up a 3-dimensional object. We can describe this object with a $ n \times m $ matrix, such that in each cell $ (i,j) $ , there are $ h_{i,j} $ bricks standing on the top of each other.
However, Serval doesn't give you any $ h_{i,j} $ , and just give you the front view, left view, and the top view of this object, and he is now asking you to restore the object. Note that in the front view, there are $ m $ columns, and in the $ i $ -th of them, the height is the maximum of $ h_{1,i},h_{2,i},\dots,h_{n,i} $ . It is similar for the left view, where there are $ n $ columns. And in the top view, there is an $ n \times m $ matrix $ t_{i,j} $ , where $ t_{i,j} $ is $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ . If $ t_{i,j} $ equals $ 1 $ , that means $ h_{i,j}>0 $ , otherwise, $ h_{i,j}=0 $ .
However, Serval is very lonely because others are bored about his unsolvable problems before, and refused to solve this one, although this time he promises there will be at least one object satisfying all the views. As his best friend, can you have a try?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three positive space-separated integers $ n, m, h $ ( $ 1\leq n, m, h \leq 100 $ ) — the length, width and height.
The second line contains $ m $ non-negative space-separated integers $ a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m $ , where $ a_i $ is the height in the $ i $ -th column from left to right of the front view ( $ 0\leq a_i \leq h $ ).
The third line contains $ n $ non-negative space-separated integers $ b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n $ ( $ 0\leq b_j \leq h $ ), where $ b_j $ is the height in the $ j $ -th column from left to right of the left view.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains $ m $ numbers, each is $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ , representing the top view, where $ j $ -th number of $ i $ -th row is $ 1 $ if $ h_{i, j}>0 $ , and $ 0 $ otherwise.
It is guaranteed that there is at least one structure satisfying the input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ lines, each of them contains $ m $ integers, the $ j $ -th number in the $ i $ -th line should be equal to the height in the corresponding position of the top view. If there are several objects satisfying the views, output any one of them.</div>
