<h1>AB-Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are two strings $ s $ and $ t $ , consisting only of letters a and b. You can make the following operation several times: choose a prefix of $ s $ , a prefix of $ t $ and swap them. Prefixes can be empty, also a prefix can coincide with a whole string.
Your task is to find a sequence of operations after which one of the strings consists only of a letters and the other consists only of b letters. The number of operations should be minimized.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=2·10^{5} $ ).
The second line contains a string $ t $ ( $ 1<=|t|<=2·10^{5} $ ).
Here $ |s| $ and $ |t| $ denote the lengths of $ s $ and $ t $ , respectively. It is guaranteed that at least one of the strings contains at least one a letter and at least one of the strings contains at least one b letter.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line should contain a single integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=5·10^{5} $ ) — the number of operations.
Each of the next $ n $ lines should contain two space-separated integers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ — the lengths of prefixes of $ s $ and $ t $ to swap, respectively.
If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any of them. It's guaranteed that a solution with given constraints exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>bab
bb

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>bbbb
aaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, you can solve the problem in two operations:
1. Swap the prefix of the first string with length $ 1 $ and the prefix of the second string with length $ 0 $ . After this swap, you'll have strings ab and bbb.
2. Swap the prefix of the first string with length $ 1 $ and the prefix of the second string with length $ 3 $ . After this swap, you'll have strings bbbb and a.
In the second example, the strings are already appropriate, so no operations are needed.</div>
