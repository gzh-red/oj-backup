<h1>Trips</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意：**
一共有$n$个人，他们开始互不认识，而每天早上不认识的两个人会变成朋友。一共有$m$天，每天晚上有的人要去旅行，去旅行的人必须满足ta有至少$k$个朋友也去旅行
求每天去旅行的最大人数
**输入格式：**
第一行3个整数，表示$n,m,k$
往下m行，每行两个整数$x,y$，表示这天早上$x$和$y$会变成朋友
**输出格式：**
共$m$行，每行一个整数，表示每天晚上最多能去旅游的人数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ persons who initially don't know each other. On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.
We want to plan a trip for every evening of $ m $ days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:
- Either this person does not go on the trip,
- Or at least $ k $ of his friends also go on the trip.
Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if $ a $ and $ b $ are friends and $ b $ and $ c $ are friends, it does not necessarily imply that $ a $ and $ c $ are friends.
For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , and $ k $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le k < n $ ) — the number of people, the number of days and the number of friends each person on the trip should have in the group.
The $ i $ -th ( $ 1 \leq i \leq m $ ) of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1\leq x, y\leq n $ , $ x\ne y $ ), meaning that persons $ x $ and $ y $ become friends on the morning of day $ i $ . It is guaranteed that $ x $ and $ y $ were not friends before.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly $ m $ lines, where the $ i $ -th of them ( $ 1\leq i\leq m $ ) contains the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on the evening of the day $ i $ .</div>
