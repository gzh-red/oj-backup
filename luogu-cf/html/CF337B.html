<h1>Routine Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>###### 题意
有一个屏幕，在放电影，已知屏幕长和宽的比为a:b，又知道放的电影的长与宽比为c:d，我们需要尽可能的让电影适配屏幕，保留正常画面，不能畸形画面。或者完全适配屏幕。计算空闲屏幕的面积，与这个屏幕的面积形成一个比。输出最简分数。
- 输入
a,b,c,d
- 输出
p/q
- PS
1. p具有非负性。
1. q为正整数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Manao has a monitor. The screen of the monitor has horizontal to vertical length ratio $ a $ : $ b $ . Now he is going to watch a movie. The movie's frame has horizontal to vertical length ratio $ c $ : $ d $ . Manao adjusts the view in such a way that the movie preserves the original frame ratio, but also occupies as much space on the screen as possible and fits within it completely. Thus, he may have to zoom the movie in or out, but Manao will always change the frame proportionally in both dimensions.
Calculate the ratio of empty screen (the part of the screen not occupied by the movie) to the total screen size. Print the answer as an irreducible fraction $ p/q $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line contains four space-separated integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ , $ d $ ( $ 1<=a,b,c,d<=1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the answer to the problem as "p/q", where $ p $ is a non-negative integer, $ q $ is a positive integer and numbers $ p $ and $ q $ don't have a common divisor larger than 1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Sample 1. Manao's monitor has a square screen. The movie has 3:2 horizontal to vertical length ratio. Obviously, the movie occupies most of the screen if the width of the picture coincides with the width of the screen. In this case, only 2/3 of the monitor will project the movie in the horizontal dimension: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF337B/429cc762b90fac9b9969eeb0bd54bb3278635967.png)
Sample 2. This time the monitor's width is 4/3 times larger than its height and the movie's frame is square. In this case, the picture must take up the whole monitor in the vertical dimension and only 3/4 in the horizontal dimension: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF337B/9da098e1ff076f33756d107ad7616fb9b6b441f1.png)</div>
