<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp wants to cook a soup. To do it, he needs to buy exactly $ n $ liters of water.
There are only two types of water bottles in the nearby shop — $ 1 $ -liter bottles and $ 2 $ -liter bottles. There are infinitely many bottles of these two types in the shop.
The bottle of the first type costs $ a $ burles and the bottle of the second type costs $ b $ burles correspondingly.
Polycarp wants to spend as few money as possible. Your task is to find the minimum amount of money (in burles) Polycarp needs to buy exactly $ n $ liters of water in the nearby shop if the bottle of the first type costs $ a $ burles and the bottle of the second type costs $ b $ burles.
You also have to answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 500 $ ) — the number of queries.
The next $ n $ lines contain queries. The $ i $ -th query is given as three space-separated integers $ n_i $ , $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \le n_i \le 10^{12}, 1 \le a_i, b_i \le 1000 $ ) — how many liters Polycarp needs in the $ i $ -th query, the cost (in burles) of the bottle of the first type in the $ i $ -th query and the cost (in burles) of the bottle of the second type in the $ i $ -th query, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers. The $ i $ -th integer should be equal to the minimum amount of money (in burles) Polycarp needs to buy exactly $ n_i $ liters of water in the nearby shop if the bottle of the first type costs $ a_i $ burles and the bottle of the second type costs $ b_i $ burles.</div>
