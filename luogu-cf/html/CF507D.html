<h1>The Maths Lecture</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Amr doesn't like Maths as he finds it really boring, so he usually sleeps in Maths lectures. But one day the teacher suspected that Amr is sleeping and asked him a question to make sure he wasn't.
First he gave Amr two positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ . Then he asked Amr, how many integer numbers $ x&gt;0 $ exist such that:
- Decimal representation of $ x $ (without leading zeroes) consists of exactly $ n $ digits;
- There exists some integer $ y&gt;0 $ such that:
- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF507D/a168a0f3214943d3090a4c18ee0075fe3a3849dd.png);
- decimal representation of $ y $ is a suffix of decimal representation of $ x $ .
As the answer to this question may be pretty huge the teacher asked Amr to output only its remainder modulo a number $ m $ .
Can you help Amr escape this embarrassing situation?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of three integers $ n,k,m $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=k<=100 $ , $ 1<=m<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
