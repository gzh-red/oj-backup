<h1>Olesya and Rodion</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意**
找到一个n位数使其能被t整除。
**输出**
如果有多个解，输出一个。如果没有解，输出“-1”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Olesya loves numbers consisting of $ n $ digits, and Rodion only likes numbers that are divisible by $ t $ . Find some number that satisfies both of them.
Your task is: given the $ n $ and $ t $ print an integer strictly larger than zero consisting of $ n $ digits that is divisible by $ t $ . If such number doesn't exist, print $ -1 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two numbers, $ n $ and $ t $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 2<=t<=10 $ ) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the problem, or $ -1 $ , if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
