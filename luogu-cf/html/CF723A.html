<h1>The New Year: Meeting Friends</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
题目描述
有三个朋友在一条笔直的岛上生活着，我们将其看做一条直线（数轴）。第一个人的家在点$x_1$​ 处，第二个人的家在点$x_2$处，第三个人的家在点$x_3$处。他们计划一起庆祝新年，所以他们需要在直线上的任一某点见面。请你帮他们找出一个点，使得他们走的总距离最短，并求出这个总距离。
输入格式
第一行有三个数，$x_1$，$x_2$​ ，$x_3$ ，(1<=$x_1$​ ，$x_2$​ ，$x_3$<=100)。分别对应第一、第二和第三个人的房子的位置。
输出格式
输出一个整数：最小的总距离以满足他们能在一起庆祝新年。
说明
在第一个样例中，朋友们应在点4见面。因此，第一个朋友必须走3个单位距离（从点7到点4），第二个朋友也要走3个单位距离（从点1到点4），而第三位朋友不用去任何地方，因为他住在点4。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are three friend living on the straight line $ Ox $ in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point $ x_{1} $ , the second friend lives at the point $ x_{2} $ , and the third friend lives at the point $ x_{3} $ . They plan to celebrate the New Year together, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total distance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the New Year?
It's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three distinct integers $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ and $ x_{3} $ ( $ 1<=x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}<=100 $ ) — the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and the third friends respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum total distance the friends need to travel in order to meet together.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>7 1 4

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, friends should meet at the point $ 4 $ . Thus, the first friend has to travel the distance of $ 3 $ (from the point $ 7 $ to the point $ 4 $ ), the second friend also has to travel the distance of $ 3 $ (from the point $ 1 $ to the point $ 4 $ ), while the third friend should not go anywhere because he lives at the point $ 4 $ .</div>
