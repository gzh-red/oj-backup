<h1>Sereja and Subsequences</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个序列，把这个序列的每一个不下降子序列拿出来
对于每一个子序列,一个可行序列为:
- 由正整数组成,长度和原子串相同
- 不大于原子串
求所有的可行串</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja has a sequence that consists of $ n $ positive integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ .
First Sereja took a piece of squared paper and wrote all distinct non-empty non-decreasing subsequences of sequence $ a $ . Then for each sequence written on the squared paper, Sereja wrote on a piece of lines paper all sequences that do not exceed it.
A sequence of positive integers $ x=x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{r} $ doesn't exceed a sequence of positive integers $ y=y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{r} $ , if the following inequation holds: $ x_{1}<=y_{1},x_{2}<=y_{2},...,x_{r}<=y_{r} $ .
Now Sereja wonders, how many sequences are written on the lines piece of paper. Help Sereja, find the required quantity modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print the answer to the problem modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
