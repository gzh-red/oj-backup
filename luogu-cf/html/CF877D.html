<h1>Olya and Energy Drinks</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>##### 题目描述
有一NxM的迷宫，'#'是墙，‘.’是路，一秒钟可以向四个方向中的一个移动1~k步，求从起点到终点的最短时间。
##### 输入格式：
第一行n、m、k，下面是NxM的迷宫，最后是起点到终点的坐标。
##### 输出格式：
输出最短时间。如果不能离开迷宫，输出-1。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Olya loves energy drinks. She loves them so much that her room is full of empty cans from energy drinks.
Formally, her room can be represented as a field of $ n×m $ cells, each cell of which is empty or littered with cans.
Olya drank a lot of energy drink, so now she can run $ k $ meters per second. Each second she chooses one of the four directions (up, down, left or right) and runs from $ 1 $ to $ k $ meters in this direction. Of course, she can only run through empty cells.
Now Olya needs to get from cell $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to cell $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ . How many seconds will it take her if she moves optimally?
It's guaranteed that cells $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ are empty. These cells can coincide.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=1000 $ ) — the sizes of the room and Olya's speed.
Then $ n $ lines follow containing $ m $ characters each, the $ i $ -th of them contains on $ j $ -th position "\#", if the cell $ (i,j) $ is littered with cans, and "." otherwise.
The last line contains four integers $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2} $ ( $ 1<=x_{1},x_{2}<=n $ , $ 1<=y_{1},y_{2}<=m $ ) — the coordinates of the first and the last cells.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum time it will take Olya to get from $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ .
If it's impossible to get from $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ , print -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample Olya should run $ 3 $ meters to the right in the first second, $ 2 $ meters down in the second second and $ 3 $ meters to the left in the third second.
In second sample Olya should run to the right for $ 3 $ seconds, then down for $ 2 $ seconds and then to the left for $ 3 $ seconds.
Olya does not recommend drinking energy drinks and generally believes that this is bad.</div>
