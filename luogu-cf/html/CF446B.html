<h1>DZY Loves Modification</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>> 给一个 n\cdot mn⋅m 的矩阵，并进行 kk 次操作，每次操作将矩阵的一行或一列的所有元素的值减 pp ，得到的分数为这次修改之前这一列/一行的元素和，求分数最大值
@[chen_zhe](/space/show?uid=8457) @[yjjr](/space/show?uid=5088)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As we know, DZY loves playing games. One day DZY decided to play with a $ n×m $ matrix. To be more precise, he decided to modify the matrix with exactly $ k $ operations.
Each modification is one of the following:
1. Pick some row of the matrix and decrease each element of the row by $ p $ . This operation brings to DZY the value of pleasure equal to the sum of elements of the row before the decreasing.
2. Pick some column of the matrix and decrease each element of the column by $ p $ . This operation brings to DZY the value of pleasure equal to the sum of elements of the column before the decreasing.
DZY wants to know: what is the largest total value of pleasure he could get after performing exactly $ k $ modifications? Please, help him to calculate this value.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n,m,k $ and $ p $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{3}; 1<=k<=10^{6}; 1<=p<=100) $ .
Then $ n $ lines follow. Each of them contains $ m $ integers representing $ a_{ij} (1<=a_{ij}<=10^{3}) $ — the elements of the current row of the matrix.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the maximum possible total pleasure value DZY could get.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 2 2 2
1 3
2 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>11
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 2 5 2
1 3
2 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>11
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample test, we can modify: column 2, row 2. After that the matrix becomes:
`<br></br>1 1<br></br>0 0<br></br><br></br>`For the second sample test, we can modify: column 2, row 2, row 1, column 1, column 2. After that the matrix becomes:
`<br></br>-3 -3<br></br>-2 -2<br></br><br></br>`</div>
