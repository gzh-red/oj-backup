<h1>Valid Sets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一棵树，树上有点权，求这棵树的满足最大点权与最小点权之差小于d的连通子图的个数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you know, an undirected connected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges is called a tree. You are given an integer $ d $ and a tree consisting of $ n $ nodes. Each node $ i $ has a value $ a_{i} $ associated with it.
We call a set $ S $ of tree nodes valid if following conditions are satisfied:
1. $ S $ is non-empty.
2. $ S $ is connected. In other words, if nodes $ u $ and $ v $ are in $ S $ , then all nodes lying on the simple path between $ u $ and $ v $ should also be presented in $ S $ .
3. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF486D/178986cc3145e106df7e442d141768e61c090be6.png).
Your task is to count the number of valid sets. Since the result can be very large, you must print its remainder modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are exactly 8 valid sets: $ {1},{2},{3},{4},{1,2},{1,3},{3,4} $ and $ {1,3,4} $ . Set $ {1,2,3,4} $ is not valid, because the third condition isn't satisfied. Set $ {1,4} $ satisfies the third condition, but conflicts with the second condition.</div>
