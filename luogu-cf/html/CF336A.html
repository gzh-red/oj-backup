<h1>Vasily the Bear and Triangle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个矩形的一个顶点为$(0,0)$，对顶点为$(x,y)$，输出一个面积最小且包含上述矩形的等腰三角形（其中一个顶点为$(0,0)$）的另外两个顶点</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point $ (0,0) $ , and the opposite vertex at point $ (x,y) $ . Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.
Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point $ B=(0,0) $ . That's why today he asks you to find two points $ A=(x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ C=(x_{2},y_{2}) $ , such that the following conditions hold:
- the coordinates of points: $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ y_{2} $ are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2} $ ;
- the triangle formed by point $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ is rectangular and isosceles (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF336A/722fcc24f0ddfe8fedfe378a89e62bfed7c996ca.png) is right);
- all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle $ ABC $ ;
- the area of triangle $ ABC $ is as small as possible.
Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.</div>
