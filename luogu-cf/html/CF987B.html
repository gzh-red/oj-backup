<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Year 2118. Androids are in mass production for decades now, and they do all the work for humans. But androids have to go to school to be able to solve creative tasks. Just like humans before.
It turns out that high school struggles are not gone. If someone is not like others, he is bullied. Vasya-8800 is an economy-class android which is produced by a little-known company. His design is not perfect, his characteristics also could be better. So he is bullied by other androids.
One of the popular pranks on Vasya is to force him to compare $ x^y $ with $ y^x $ . Other androids can do it in milliseconds while Vasya's memory is too small to store such big numbers.
Please help Vasya! Write a fast program to compare $ x^y $ with $ y^x $ for Vasya, maybe then other androids will respect him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the only line of input there are two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1 \le x, y \le 10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If $ x^y < y^x $ , then print '<' (without quotes). If $ x^y > y^x $ , then print '>' (without quotes). If $ x^y = y^x $ , then print '=' (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 8
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>&amp;gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>10 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>6 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>=
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example $ 5^8 = 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 390625 $ , and $ 8^5 = 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32768 $ . So you should print '>'.
In the second example $ 10^3 = 1000 < 3^{10} = 59049 $ .
In the third example $ 6^6 = 46656 = 6^6 $ .</div>
