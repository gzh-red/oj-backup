<h1>Euclidean Distance</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a multiset of points on the plane with integer coordinates. Find the maximum distance between two points from this multiset.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number of points $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=50 $ ). Next, $ n $ pairs of lines follow, each describing a single point: the first line contains $ x $ -coordinate, the second one — the $ y $ -coordinate ( $ -50<=x,y<=50 $ ). Some of the points can have identical coordinates.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the maximum distance between two points from this multiset. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-4} $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case the maximum distance is between points $ (0,1) $ and $ (4,5) $ . In the second case two of the points are the same, so the maximum distance is between one of them and the third point.</div>
