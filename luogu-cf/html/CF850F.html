<h1>Rainbow Balls</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一袋 $n$ 个颜色球，第 $i$ 个颜色的球有 $a_i$ 个。
当袋子里至少有两个不同颜色的球时，执行以下步骤:
1. 一个接一个的按照顺序随机取出两个的球，这些球的颜色可能是一样的。
2. 把第二个球涂成第一个球的颜色，然后把两个球放回袋子里。
所有这些动作只需要一秒钟。
输出无法操作时候的期望时间
对 $10^9+7$ 取模
$n\le 2500,1\le a_i \le 10^5$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a bag of balls of $ n $ different colors. You have $ a_{i} $ balls of the $ i $ -th color.
While there are at least two different colored balls in the bag, perform the following steps:
- Take out two random balls without replacement one by one. These balls might be the same color.
- Color the second ball to the color of the first ball. You are not allowed to switch the order of the balls in this step.
- Place both balls back in the bag.
- All these actions take exactly one second.
Let $ M=10^{9}+7 $ . It can be proven that the expected amount of time needed before you stop can be represented as a rational number ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850F/2c40be71c60fe708ee9e4e80e2cd7a26163f3bd6.png), where $ P $ and $ Q $ are coprime integers and where $ Q $ is not divisible by $ M $ . Return the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850F/a816c54f8859ee12f4e38a2cc4dba0d6f8dd5c0b.png).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will contain a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2500 $ ) — the number of colors.
The next line of input will contain $ n $ space separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of balls of each color.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, the answer to the problem.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, no matter what happens, the balls will become the same color after one step.
For the second sample, we have 6 balls. Let’s label the balls from 1 to 6, and without loss of generality, let’s say balls 1,2,3 are initially color 1, balls 4,5 are color 2, and ball 6 are color 3.
Here is an example of how these steps can go:
- We choose ball 5 and ball 6. Ball 6 then becomes color 2.
- We choose ball 4 and ball 5. Ball 5 remains the same color (color 2).
- We choose ball 1 and ball 5. Ball 5 becomes color 1.
- We choose ball 6 and ball 5. Ball 5 becomes color 2.
- We choose ball 3 and ball 4. Ball 4 becomes color 1.
- We choose ball 4 and ball 6. Ball 6 becomes color 1.
- We choose ball 2 and ball 5. Ball 5 becomes color 1.
At this point, the game ends since all the balls are the same color. This particular sequence took 7 seconds.It can be shown that the answer to this case is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850F/9f76609d2f8aa0999ab074d70f32e2692cee15a9.png).</div>
