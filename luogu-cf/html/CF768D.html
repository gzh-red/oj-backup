<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个人要取N件物品，一天只能取一件物品，但不能确定取到的是什么物品，求将N件物品恰好取完的天数的概率不小于（p/2000）的天数 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jon Snow is on the lookout for some orbs required to defeat the white walkers. There are $ k $ different types of orbs and he needs at least one of each. One orb spawns daily at the base of a Weirwood tree north of the wall. The probability of this orb being of any kind is equal. As the north of wall is full of dangers, he wants to know the minimum number of days he should wait before sending a ranger to collect the orbs such that the probability of him getting at least one of each kind of orb is at least ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF768D/084e5b8c9ee986cd51e443adb59a2f8594ceba38.png), where $ ε&lt;10^{-7} $ .
To better prepare himself, he wants to know the answer for $ q $ different values of $ p_{i} $ . Since he is busy designing the battle strategy with Sam, he asks you for your help.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line consists of two space separated integers $ k $ , $ q $ ( $ 1<=k,q<=1000 $ ) — number of different kinds of orbs and number of queries respectively.
Each of the next $ q $ lines contain a single integer $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=1000 $ ) — $ i $ -th query.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ q $ lines. On $ i $ -th of them output single integer — answer for $ i $ -th query.</div>
