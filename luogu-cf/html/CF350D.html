<h1>Looking for Owls</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Emperor Palpatine loves owls very much. The emperor has some blueprints with the new Death Star, the blueprints contain $ n $ distinct segments and $ m $ distinct circles. We will consider the segments indexed from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in some way and the circles — indexed from $ 1 $ to $ m $ in some way.
Palpatine defines an owl as a set of a pair of distinct circles $ (i,j) $ ( $ i&lt;j $ ) and one segment $ k $ , such that:
1. circles $ i $ and $ j $ are symmetrical relatively to the straight line containing segment $ k $ ;
2. circles $ i $ and $ j $ don't have any common points;
3. circles $ i $ and $ j $ have the same radius;
4. segment $ k $ intersects the segment that connects the centers of circles $ i $ and $ j $ .
Help Palpatine, count the number of distinct owls on the picture.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers — $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ , $ 2<=m<=1500 $ ).
The next $ n $ lines contain four integers each, $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ — the coordinates of the two endpoints of the segment. It's guaranteed that each segment has positive length.
The next $ m $ lines contain three integers each, $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ — the coordinates of the center and the radius of the $ i $ -th circle. All coordinates are integers of at most $ 10^{4} $ in their absolute value. The radius is a positive integer of at most $ 10^{4} $ .
It is guaranteed that all segments and all circles are dictinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the answer to the problem.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to output 64-bit integers is С++. It is preferred to use the cout stream or the %I64d specifier.</div>
