<h1>Different variables</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> $ N $ variables $ X_{1},...,X_{N} $ can have positive integer values. You are given $ K $ constraints for these value that look like "the values of variables $ X_{i1},X_{i2},...,X_{iM} $ are different". Among all possible lists of values of these variables that satisfy these constraints select the ones which have minimum possible $ max(X_{i}) $ . Output lexicographically least of these lists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=N<=10 $ , $ 1<=K<=100 $ ) — the number of variables and the number of constraints.
The following $ K $ lines contain the constraints, formatted as follows: the first number in the line $ M $ ( $ 2<=M<=N $ ) gives the number of variables in the constraint. After it follow $ M $ space-separated integers $ i_{1},...,i_{M} $ — the indices of the variables used in the constraint ( $ 1<=i_{j}<=N $ ). All $ i_{j} $ in one constraint are different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the values of $ X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{N} $ in a single line, separated with single spaces.</div>
