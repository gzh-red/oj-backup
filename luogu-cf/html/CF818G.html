<h1>Four Melodies</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Author note: I think some of you might remember the problem "Two Melodies" from Eductational Codeforces Round 22. Now it's time to make it a bit more difficult!
Alice is a composer, and recently she had recorded two tracks that became very popular. Now she has got a lot of fans who are waiting for new tracks.
This time Alice wants to form four melodies for her tracks.
Alice has a sheet with $ n $ notes written on it. She wants to take four such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that all of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.
Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Subsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differ by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.
You should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such four non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that all of them form a melody.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 4<=n<=3000 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — notes written on a sheet.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print maximum sum of lengths of such four non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that all of them form a melody.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it is possible to compose $ 4 $ melodies by choosing any $ 4 $ notes (and each melody will consist of only one note).
In the second example it is possible to compose one melody with $ 2 $ notes — $ {1,2} $ . Remaining notes are used in other three melodies (one note per each melody).</div>
