<h1>Ice Cream</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Summer in Berland lasts $ n $ days, the price of one portion of ice cream on the $ i $ -th day is $ c_i $ . Over the summer, Tanya wants to eat exactly $ k $ portions of ice cream. At the same time, on the $ i $ -th day, she decided that she would eat at least $ a_i $ portions, but not more than $ b_i $ ( $ a_i \le b_i $ ) portions. In other words, let $ d_i $ be equal to the number of portions that she eats on the $ i $ -th day. Then $ d_1+d_2+\dots+d_n=k $ and $ a_i \le d_i \le b_i $ for each $ i $ .
Given that portions of ice cream can only be eaten on the day of purchase, find the minimum amount of money that Tanya can spend on ice cream in the summer.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5 $ , $ 0 \le k \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of days and the total number of servings of ice cream that Tanya will eat in the summer.
The following $ n $ lines contain descriptions of the days, one description per line. Each description consists of three integers $ a_i, b_i, c_i $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \le b_i \le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \le c_i \le 10^6 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum amount of money that Tanya can spend on ice cream in the summer. If there is no way for Tanya to buy and satisfy all the requirements, then print -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Tanya needs to eat $ 3 $ portions of ice cream on the first day, $ 1 $ portions of ice cream on the second day and $ 3 $ portions of ice cream on the third day. In this case, the amount of money spent is $ 3\cdot6+1\cdot4+3\cdot3=31 $ . It can be shown that any other valid way to eat exactly $ 7 $ portions of ice cream costs more.</div>
