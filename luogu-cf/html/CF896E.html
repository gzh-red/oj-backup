<h1>Welcome home, Chtholly</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>维护一个$n(n\leqslant 100000)$个元素序列$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$，有$m(m\leqslant 100000)$次操作，分为如下两种。
1. 给定$l,r,x$，将$a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r$中所有大于$x$的元素减去$x$
2. 给定$l,r,x$，询问$a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r$中，有多少个元素恰好等于$x$
$1\leqslant l\leqslant r\leqslant n,1\leqslant a_i,x\leqslant 100000$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>— I... I survived.
— Welcome home, Chtholly.
— I kept my promise...
— I made it... I really made it!
After several days of fighting, Chtholly Nota Seniorious miraculously returned from the fierce battle.
As promised, Willem is now baking butter cake for her.
However, although Willem is skilled in making dessert, he rarely bakes butter cake.
This time, Willem made a big mistake — he accidentally broke the oven!
Fortunately, Chtholly decided to help him.
Willem puts $ n $ cakes on a roll, cakes are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the $ i $ -th cake needs $ a_{i} $ seconds of baking.
Willem needs Chtholly to do $ m $ operations to bake the cakes.
Operation 1: $ 1\ l\ r\ x $
Willem asks Chtholly to check each cake in the range $ [l,r] $ , if the cake needs to be baked for more than $ x $ seconds, he would bake it for $ x $ seconds and put it back in its place. More precisely, for every $ i $ in range $ [l,r] $ , if $ a_{i} $ is strictly more than $ x $ , $ a_{i} $ becomes equal $ a_{i}-x $ .
Operation 2: $ 2\ l\ r\ x $
Willem asks Chtholly to count the number of cakes in the range $ [l,r] $ that needs to be cooked for exactly $ x $ seconds. More formally you should find number of such $ i $ in range $ [l,r] $ , that $ a_{i}=x $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5}) $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers, $ i $ -th of them is $ a_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{5}) $ .
The next $ m $ lines are the $ m $ operations described above. It is guaranteed that $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ and $ 1<=x<=10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each operation of the second type, print the answer.</div>
