<h1>Rounding</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个数字，将其“四舍六入”，末尾为5舍去或进位都可，求最终的数字。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has a non-negative integer $ n $ . He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with $ 0 $ . If $ n $ already ends up with $ 0 $ , Vasya considers it already rounded.
For example, if $ n=4722 $ answer is $ 4720 $ . If $ n=5 $ Vasya can round it to $ 0 $ or to $ 10 $ . Both ways are correct.
For given $ n $ find out to which integer will Vasya round it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{9} $ ) — number that Vasya has.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print result of rounding $ n $ . Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>113
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>110
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>1000000000
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>1000000000
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>5432359
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>5432360
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example $ n=5 $ . Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are $ 0 $ and $ 10 $ . Any of these answers is correct, so you can print $ 0 $ or $ 10 $ .</div>
