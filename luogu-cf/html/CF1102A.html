<h1>Integer Sequence Dividing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个数n，求把1~n的整数分为两组，使得每组的和的差的绝对值最小。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an integer sequence $ 1, 2, \dots, n $ . You have to divide it into two sets $ A $ and $ B $ in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and $ |sum(A) - sum(B)| $ is minimum possible.
The value $ |x| $ is the absolute value of $ x $ and $ sum(S) $ is the sum of elements of the set $ S $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum possible value of $ |sum(A) - sum(B)| $ if you divide the initial sequence $ 1, 2, \dots, n $ into two sets $ A $ and $ B $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Some (not all) possible answers to examples:
In the first example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $ A = \{1, 2\} $ and $ B = \{3\} $ so the answer is $ 0 $ .
In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $ A = \{1, 3, 4\} $ and $ B = \{2, 5\} $ so the answer is $ 1 $ .
In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets $ A = \{1, 4, 5\} $ and $ B = \{2, 3, 6\} $ so the answer is $ 1 $ .</div>
