<h1>Ratings and Reality Shows</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are two main kinds of events in the life of top-model: fashion shows and photo shoots. Participating in any of these events affects the rating of appropriate top-model. After each photo shoot model's rating increases by $ a $ and after each fashion show decreases by $ b $ (designers do too many experiments nowadays). Moreover, sometimes top-models participates in talk shows. After participating in talk show model becomes more popular and increasing of her rating after photo shoots become $ c $ and decreasing of her rating after fashion show becomes $ d $ .
Izabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will never become negative. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show.
Let's assume that model's career begins in moment 0. At that moment Izabella's rating was equal to $ start $ . If talk show happens in moment $ t $ if will affect all events in model's life in interval of time $ [t..t+len) $ (including $ t $ and not including $ t+len $ ), where $ len $ is duration of influence.
Izabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will not become become negative before talk show or during period of influence of talk show. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In first line there are 7 positive integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ , $ d $ , $ start $ , $ len $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ , $ 0<=start<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=a,b,c,d,len<=10^{9} $ ), where $ n $ is a number of fashion shows and photo shoots, $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ and $ d $ are rating changes described above, $ start $ is an initial rating of model and $ len $ is a duration of influence of talk show.
In next $ n $ lines descriptions of events are given. Each of those lines contains two integers $ t_{i} $ and $ q_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{9} $ , $ 0<=q<=1 $ ) — moment, in which event happens and type of this event. Type 0 corresponds to the fashion show and type 1 — to photo shoot.
Events are given in order of increasing $ t_{i} $ , all $ t_{i} $ are different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one non-negative integer $ t $ — the moment of time in which talk show should happen to make Izabella's rating non-negative before talk show and during period of influence of talk show. If there are multiple answers print smallest of them. If there are no such moments, print $ -1 $ .</div>
