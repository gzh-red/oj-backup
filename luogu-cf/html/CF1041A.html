<h1>Heist</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
昨晚有一家电子商店被抢劫了。
昨天在商店里的所有键盘都是从$x$开始按升序编号的。例如，如果$x=4$，并且商店中有$3$个键盘，那么编号就为$4,5,6$；如果$x=10$，并且有$7$个键盘，那么编号就为$10,11,12,13,14,15,16$。
在抢劫之后，只有$n$个键盘仍然存在，他们的编号分别为$a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_n$。计算被盗的键盘的最小可能数量。工作人员不记得$x$也不记得商店里原来有几个键盘。
## 输入输出格式
###### 输入格式：
第一行输入一个整数$n(1\le n\le 100)$，为商店里仍然存在的键盘的数量。
第二行输入$n$个整数$a_1,a_2\dots ,a_n(1\le a_i\le 10^9)$，表示所有商店里仍然存在的键盘的编号。
###### 输出格式：
输出被盗的键盘的最小可能数量。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There was an electronic store heist last night.
All keyboards which were in the store yesterday were numbered in ascending order from some integer number $ x $ . For example, if $ x = 4 $ and there were $ 3 $ keyboards in the store, then the devices had indices $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 6 $ , and if $ x = 10 $ and there were $ 7 $ of them then the keyboards had indices $ 10 $ , $ 11 $ , $ 12 $ , $ 13 $ , $ 14 $ , $ 15 $ and $ 16 $ .
After the heist, only $ n $ keyboards remain, and they have indices $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ . Calculate the minimum possible number of keyboards that have been stolen. The staff remember neither $ x $ nor the number of keyboards in the store before the heist.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ $ (1 \le n \le 1\,000) $ — the number of keyboards in the store that remained after the heist.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ $ (1 \le a_i \le 10^{9}) $ — the indices of the remaining keyboards. The integers $ a_i $ are given in arbitrary order and are pairwise distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum possible number of keyboards that have been stolen if the staff remember neither $ x $ nor the number of keyboards in the store before the heist.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, if $ x=8 $ then minimum number of stolen keyboards is equal to $ 2 $ . The keyboards with indices $ 9 $ and $ 11 $ were stolen during the heist.
In the second example, if $ x=4 $ then nothing was stolen during the heist.</div>
