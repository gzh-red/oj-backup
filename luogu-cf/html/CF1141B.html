<h1>Maximal Continuous Rest</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个长度为 $n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$ 的只含 $01$ 的环形序列（数据保证里面至少有一个$0$），问最长连续只含 $1$ 的子串长度为多少</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Each day in Berland consists of $ n $ hours. Polycarp likes time management. That's why he has a fixed schedule for each day — it is a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ (each $ a_i $ is either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ ), where $ a_i=0 $ if Polycarp works during the $ i $ -th hour of the day and $ a_i=1 $ if Polycarp rests during the $ i $ -th hour of the day.
Days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.
What is the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests? It is guaranteed that there is at least one working hour in a day.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<div>The first line contains $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5 $ ) — number of hours per day.
The second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \le 1 $ ), where $ a_i=0 $ if the $ i $ -th hour in a day is working and $ a_i=1 $ if the $ i $ -th hour is resting. It is guaranteed that $ a_i=0 $ for at least one $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. Remember that you should consider that days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.</div>
