<h1>Verse Pattern</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述**
你现在有n句话，还有他们分别对应的应有的元音个数，现在要你判断每句话是否都含有正确的元音（**a,e,i,o,u,y**）个数。
**输入格式**
第一行一个正整数n( 1<=n<=100），表示有n句话。第二行有n个正整数p1~pn( 0<=pi<=100)，表示第i句话有pi个元音。第3~n+2行每行有一句话（包含空格）。
**输出格式**
一行，如果所有句子的元音个数都符合，则输出“YES”，反之则输出“NO”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a text consisting of $ n $ lines. Each line contains some space-separated words, consisting of lowercase English letters.
We define a syllable as a string that contains exactly one vowel and any arbitrary number (possibly none) of consonants. In English alphabet following letters are considered to be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y'.
Each word of the text that contains at least one vowel can be divided into syllables. Each character should be a part of exactly one syllable. For example, the word "mamma" can be divided into syllables as "ma" and "mma", "mam" and "ma", and "mamm" and "a". Words that consist of only consonants should be ignored.
The verse patterns for the given text is a sequence of $ n $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ . Text matches the given verse pattern if for each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ one can divide words of the $ i $ -th line in syllables in such a way that the total number of syllables is equal to $ p_{i} $ .
You are given the text and the verse pattern. Check, if the given text matches the given verse pattern.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of lines in the text.
The second line contains integers $ p_{1},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=100 $ ) — the verse pattern.
Next $ n $ lines contain the text itself. Text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces. It's guaranteed that all lines are non-empty, each line starts and ends with a letter and words are separated by exactly one space. The length of each line doesn't exceed $ 100 $ characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the given text matches the given verse pattern, then print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the output. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, one can split words into syllables in the following way:
`in-tel<br></br>co-de<br></br>ch al-len-ge<br></br>`Since the word "ch" in the third line doesn't contain vowels, we can ignore it. As the result we get $ 2 $ syllabels in first two lines and $ 3 $ syllables in the third one.</div>
