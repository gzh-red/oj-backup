<h1>The Child and Set</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你两个整数n,m，要求在m中选几个数，使得这几个数Lowbit值正好等于n
输入：
两个数n,m
输出：
第一行：选了几个数
第二行：这几个数，用空格分开，有多解输出任意一解，无解输出-1
样例1解释 lowbit(4)=4,lowbit(5)=1,4+1=5
样例2解释lowbit(2)=2,lowbit(1)=1,lowbit(3)=12+1+1=4

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite set of Picks.
Fortunately, Picks remembers something about his set $ S $ :
- its elements were distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ limit $ ;
- the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF437B/88e174ec7cf915d3f747f56e083fd307f02a2ea9.png) was equal to $ sum $ ; here $ lowbit(x) $ equals $ 2^{k} $ where $ k $ is the position of the first one in the binary representation of $ x $ . For example, $ lowbit(10010_{2})=10_{2},lowbit(10001_{2})=1_{2},lowbit(10000_{2})=10000_{2} $ (binary representation).
Can you help Picks and find any set $ S $ , that satisfies all the above conditions?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers: $ sum,limit $ $ (1<=sum,limit<=10^{5}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ , denoting the size of $ S $ . Then print the elements of set $ S $ in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
If it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1.</div>
