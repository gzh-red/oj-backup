<h1>Sereja and Stairs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja loves integer sequences very much. He especially likes stairs.
Sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{|a|} $ ( $ |a| $ is the length of the sequence) is stairs if there is such index $ i $ $ (1<=i<=|a|) $ , that the following condition is met:
$ a_{1}&lt;a_{2}&lt;...&lt;a_{i-1}&lt;a_{i}&gt;a_{i+1}&gt;...&gt;a_{|a|-1}&gt;a_{|a|}. $ For example, sequences \[1, 2, 3, 2\] and \[4, 2\] are stairs and sequence \[3, 1, 2\] isn't.
Sereja has $ m $ cards with numbers. He wants to put some cards on the table in a row to get a stair sequence. What maximum number of cards can he put on the table?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=10^{5}) $ — the number of Sereja's cards. The second line contains $ m $ integers $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=5000) $ — the numbers on the Sereja's cards.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the number of cards you can put on the table. In the second line print the resulting stairs.</div>
