<h1>The Best Gift</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Emily的生日就在下个星期，Jack决定给她买件礼物。
他知道她喜欢书，所以他决定去当地书店，那里有$m$ 个种类的$n$ 本书。
在书店里，杰克决定买两本不同类型的书。
杰克希望知道有多少种不同的方案能够买两本**不同种类**的书给Emily。
如果两个方案中有一本书不属于同一个种类，就被视为是不同方案。
这些书是由他们的种类给出的，种类按照编号有$1$ 到$m$ 给出。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Emily's birthday is next week and Jack has decided to buy a present for her. He knows she loves books so he goes to the local bookshop, where there are $ n $ books on sale from one of $ m $ genres.
In the bookshop, Jack decides to buy two books of different genres.
Based on the genre of books on sale in the shop, find the number of options available to Jack for choosing two books of different genres for Emily. Options are considered different if they differ in at least one book.
The books are given by indices of their genres. The genres are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5},2<=m<=10 $ ) — the number of books in the bookstore and the number of genres.
The second line contains a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , where $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=m $ ) equals the genre of the $ i $ -th book.
It is guaranteed that for each genre there is at least one book of that genre.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<div>Print the only integer — the number of ways in which Jack can choose books.
It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed the value $ 2·10^{9} $ .</div>
