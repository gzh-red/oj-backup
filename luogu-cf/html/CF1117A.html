<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given array $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ . Find the subsegment $ a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r $ ( $ 1 \le l \le r \le n $ ) with maximum arithmetic mean $ \frac{1}{r - l + 1}\sum\limits_{i=l}^{r}{a_i} $ (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).
If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — length of the array $ a $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \le 10^9 $ ) — the array $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.</div>
