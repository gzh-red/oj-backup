<h1>Edges in MST</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
题目大意:
给一个带权的无向图,保证没有自环和重边. 由于最小生成树不唯一,因此你需要确定每一条边是以下三种情况哪一个 1.一定在所有MST上 2.可能在某个MST上 3.一定不可能在任何MST上
输入
第一行给出n,m表示点数和边数. 数据范围见原题面 之后m行,每行给出ai,bi,wi 表示一个边的两个端点和边的权值.保证没有自环与重边.
输出
你需要输出m行,每行依次表示输入的第几条边,如果是情况1,输出 "any"(不包含引号);如果是情况2,输出 "at least one"(不包含引号);如果是情况3,输出 "none"(不包含引号).
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a connected weighted undirected graph without any loops and multiple edges.
Let us remind you that a graph's spanning tree is defined as an acyclic connected subgraph of the given graph that includes all of the graph's vertexes. The weight of a tree is defined as the sum of weights of the edges that the given tree contains. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph is defined as the graph's spanning tree having the minimum possible weight. For any connected graph obviously exists the minimum spanning tree, but in the general case, a graph's minimum spanning tree is not unique.
Your task is to determine the following for each edge of the given graph: whether it is either included in any MST, or included at least in one MST, or not included in any MST.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF160D/1841eb9adb257200301ec3daad18abd00c456982.png)) — the number of the graph's vertexes and edges, correspondingly. Then follow $ m $ lines, each of them contains three integers — the description of the graph's edges as " $ a_{i} $ $ b_{i} $ $ w_{i} $ " ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,1<=w_{i}<=10^{6},a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are the numbers of vertexes connected by the $ i $ -th edge, $ w_{i} $ is the edge's weight. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain loops or multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ lines — the answers for all edges. If the $ i $ -th edge is included in any MST, print "any"; if the $ i $ -th edge is included at least in one MST, print "at least one"; if the $ i $ -th edge isn't included in any MST, print "none". Print the answers for the edges in the order in which the edges are specified in the input.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the second sample the MST is unique for the given graph: it contains two first edges.
In the third sample any two edges form the MST for the given graph. That means that each edge is included at least in one MST.</div>
