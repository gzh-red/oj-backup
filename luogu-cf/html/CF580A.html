<h1>Kefa and First Steps</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求一个序列中的最长不下降子段的长度</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly $ n $ days. He knows that on the $ i $ -th day ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) he makes $ a_{i} $ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $ a_{i} $ . Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.
Help Kefa cope with this task!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence $ a $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6
2 2 1 3 4 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3
2 2 9
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.
In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.</div>
