<h1>Yaroslav and Two Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Yaroslav thinks that two strings $ s $ and $ w $ , consisting of digits and having length $ n $ are non-comparable if there are two numbers, $ i $ and $ j $ $ (1<=i,j<=n) $ , such that $ s_{i}&gt;w_{i} $ and $ s_{j}&lt;w_{j} $ . Here sign $ s_{i} $ represents the $ i $ -th digit of string $ s $ , similarly, $ w_{j} $ represents the $ j $ -th digit of string $ w $ .
A string's template is a string that consists of digits and question marks ("?").
Yaroslav has two string templates, each of them has length $ n $ . Yaroslav wants to count the number of ways to replace all question marks by some integers in both templates, so as to make the resulting strings incomparable. Note that the obtained strings can contain leading zeroes and that distinct question marks can be replaced by distinct or the same integers.
Help Yaroslav, calculate the remainder after dividing the described number of ways by $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the length of both templates. The second line contains the first template — a string that consists of digits and characters "?". The string's length equals $ n $ . The third line contains the second template in the same format.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first test contains no question marks and both strings are incomparable, so the answer is $ 1 $ .
The second test has no question marks, but the given strings are comparable, so the answer is $ 0 $ .</div>
