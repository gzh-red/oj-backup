<h1>Timofey and a tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一棵无根树中各个节点被染上了一种颜色c[i] 
现在让你选择一个点作为根节点，使得这个根节点的所有儿子满足以该儿子节点的作为根的子树中所有点颜色均相同（不同儿子为根的子树颜色可以不同）。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Each New Year Timofey and his friends cut down a tree of $ n $ vertices and bring it home. After that they paint all the $ n $ its vertices, so that the $ i $ -th vertex gets color $ c_{i} $ .
Now it's time for Timofey birthday, and his mother asked him to remove the tree. Timofey removes the tree in the following way: he takes some vertex in hands, while all the other vertices move down so that the tree becomes rooted at the chosen vertex. After that Timofey brings the tree to a trash can.
Timofey doesn't like it when many colors are mixing together. A subtree annoys him if there are vertices of different color in it. Timofey wants to find a vertex which he should take in hands so that there are no subtrees that annoy him. He doesn't consider the whole tree as a subtree since he can't see the color of the root vertex.
A subtree of some vertex is a subgraph containing that vertex and all its descendants.
Your task is to determine if there is a vertex, taking which in hands Timofey wouldn't be annoyed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ , $ u≠v $ ), denoting there is an edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ . It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=10^{5} $ ), denoting the colors of the vertices.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "NO" in a single line, if Timofey can't take the tree in such a way that it doesn't annoy him.
Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line print the index of the vertex which Timofey should take in hands. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
