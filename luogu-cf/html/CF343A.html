<h1>Rational Resistance</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mad scientist Mike is building a time machine in his spare time. To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value.
However, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistance $ R_{0}=1 $ . Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements:
1. one resistor;
2. an element and one resistor plugged in sequence;
3. an element and one resistor plugged in parallel.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343A/f117fcf32ddafc80e319e28fce885c21483edc5b.png)With the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equals $ R=R_{e}+R_{0} $ . With the parallel connection the resistance of the new element equals ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343A/a708eb8090c66cbbd34afced0c36506bcb612681.png). In this case $ R_{e} $ equals the resistance of the element being connected.
Mike needs to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343A/eecd60ed91fbeebe74e2406ea1a11d26df905945.png). Determine the smallest possible number of resistors he needs to make such an element.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single input line contains two space-separated integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{18} $ ). It is guaranteed that the fraction ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343A/eecd60ed91fbeebe74e2406ea1a11d26df905945.png) is irreducible. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the answer to the problem.
Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is recommended to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, one resistor is enough.
In the second sample one can connect the resistors in parallel, take the resulting element and connect it to a third resistor consecutively. Then, we get an element with resistance ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF343A/234023ef6c61445a95e9903d46cd7846f3823141.png). We cannot make this element using two resistors.</div>
