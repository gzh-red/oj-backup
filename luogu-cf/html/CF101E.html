<h1>Candies and Stones</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小杰拉尔德和他的教练迈克玩一个有趣的游戏。游戏开始时，有n个糖果和m块石头。杰拉尔德和迈克轮流行动，迈克先行动。迈克行动时，他会检查杰拉尔德吃了多少糖果和石头。如果杰拉尔德吃了a块糖和b块石头，他就会得到f（A，B）奖分。杰拉尔德行动时，他要么从糖果堆里吃掉一块糖果，要么从石头堆里吃掉一块石头。当迈克看到杰拉尔德把除了一块糖和一块石头之外的糖果和石头都吃光时，他最后一次得分，游戏结束。迈克不允许杰拉尔德吃所有的糖果，也不允许他吃所有的石头。编程求出杰拉尔德如何游戏才能获得最大的分数。
输入格式
第一行，三个整数n,m,p(1<=n,m<=20000,1<=p<=10^9)
第二行，n个整数x0,x1,···xn
第三行，n个整数y0,y1,···yn
f(a,b)=(xa+yb)%p
输出格式
第一行：杰拉尔德能得到的最大分数
第二行：n+m-2个字符，其中每一个都是C或S；
如果第i个字符是C，表示得到最大分数情况下杰拉尔德第i次行动应该选择吃糖果；如果第i个字符是S，则表示得到最大分数情况下杰拉尔德第i次行动应该选择吃石头。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Gerald and his coach Mike play an interesting game. At the beginning of the game there is a pile consisting of $ n $ candies and a pile consisting of $ m $ stones. Gerald and Mike move in turns, Mike goes first. During his move Mike checks how many candies and stones Gerald has eaten. Let Gerald eat $ a $ candies and $ b $ stones. Then Mike awards Gerald $ f(a,b) $ prize points. Gerald during his move either eats a candy from the pile of candies or a stone from the pile of stones. As Mike sees that Gerald has eaten everything apart one candy and one stone, he awards points for the last time and the game ends. Gerald is not allowed to eat all the candies, and he is not allowed to eat all the stones too. Tell Gerald how to play to get the largest possible number of points: it is required to find one of the possible optimal playing strategies for Gerald.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n,m,p $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=20000 $ , $ 1<=p<=10^{9} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{0} $ , $ x_{1} $ , ..., $ x_{n-1} $ ( $ 0<=x_{i}<=20000 $ ). The third line contains $ m $ integers $ y_{0} $ , $ y_{1} $ , ..., $ y_{m-1} $ ( $ 0<=y_{i}<=20000 $ ). The value of $ f(a,b) $ is calculated as a remainder of the division of the sum $ x_{a}+y_{b} $ by number $ p $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test if Gerald's first move is eating a stone, he will receive a point for it and if he eats a candy, he will get zero pints. In any way Gerald will get $ 0 $ points before his first move, and $ 1 $ after his second one. This, the maximum number of points Gerald can get equals to $ 2 $ , and for that he should first eat a stone, then a candy.</div>
