<h1>Mashmokh and ACM</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>如果一个数列中，后一个数都能被前面一个数整除，那么就叫这个数列为好数列。输入n，k，求数列中最大元素为n，数列长度为k的好数列的种数（对1000000007取模）
由 @ROBOT233 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mashmokh's boss, Bimokh, didn't like Mashmokh. So he fired him. Mashmokh decided to go to university and participate in ACM instead of finding a new job. He wants to become a member of Bamokh's team. In order to join he was given some programming tasks and one week to solve them. Mashmokh is not a very experienced programmer. Actually he is not a programmer at all. So he wasn't able to solve them. That's why he asked you to help him with these tasks. One of these tasks is the following.
A sequence of $ l $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{l} $ $ (1<=b_{1}<=b_{2}<=...<=b_{l}<=n) $ is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF414B/c97c90bdd5f34b7b09ca5088db0c88621395bd9c.png) for all $ i $ $ (1<=i<=l-1) $ .
Given $ n $ and $ k $ find the number of good sequences of length $ k $ . As the answer can be rather large print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $ n,k (1<=n,k<=2000) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the number of good sequences of length $ k $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
