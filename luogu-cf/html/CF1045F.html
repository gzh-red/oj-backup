<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Ani和Borna又在玩游戏了，他们有一个关于x和y的未填系数的多项式。Borna先将多项式系数填上（必须为正整数），Ani删去其中一项。当多项式有下界时算Borna赢，否则算Ani赢。给出多项式每一项x,y的指数，求出在双方都采用最优策略下的胜者是Ani还是Borna。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ani and Borna are playing a short game on a two-variable polynomial. It's a special kind of a polynomial: the monomials are fixed, but all of its coefficients are fill-in-the-blanks dashes, e.g. $ $$$ \_ xy + \_ x^4 y^7 + \_ x^8 y^3 + \ldots $ $ </p><p>Borna will fill in the blanks with positive integers. He wants the polynomial to be <span class="tex-font-style-underline">bounded from below</span>, i.e. his goal is to make sure there exists a real number $ M $ such that the value of the polynomial at any point is greater than $ M$$$.
Ani is mischievous, and wants the polynomial to be unbounded. Along with stealing Borna's heart, she can also steal parts of polynomials. Ani is only a petty kind of thief, though: she can only steal at most one monomial from the polynomial before Borna fills in the blanks.
If Ani and Borna play their only moves optimally, who wins?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a positive integer $ N $ $ (2 \leq N \leq 200\, 000) $ , denoting the number of the terms in the starting special polynomial.
Each of the following $ N $ lines contains a description of a monomial: the $ k $ -th line contains two \*\*space\*\*-separated integers $ a_k $ and $ b_k $ $ (0 \leq a_k, b_k \leq 10^9 $ ) which mean the starting polynomial has the term $ \_ x^{a_k} y^{b_k} $ . It is guaranteed that for $ k \neq l $ , either $ a_k \neq a_l $ or $ b_k \neq b_l $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Borna can always choose the coefficients such that the resulting polynomial is bounded from below, regardless of what monomial Ani steals, output "Borna". Else, output "Ani".
You shouldn't output the quotation marks.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
1 1
2 0

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Borna
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the initial polynomial is $ \_xy+ \_x^2 + \_y^2 $ . If Ani steals the $ \_y^2 $ term, Borna is left with $ \_xy+\_x^2 $ . Whatever positive integers are written on the blanks, $ y \rightarrow -\infty $ and $ x := 1 $ makes the whole expression go to negative infinity.
In the second sample, the initial polynomial is $ \_1 + \_x + \_x^2 + \_x^8 $ . One can check that no matter what term Ani steals, Borna can always win.</div>
