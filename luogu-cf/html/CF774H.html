<h1>Repairing Of String</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Stepan had a favorite string $ s $ which consisted of the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.
After graduation, he decided to remember it, but it was a long time ago, so he can't now remember it. But Stepan remembers some information about the string, namely the sequence of integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ , where $ n $ equals the length of the string $ s $ , and $ c_{i} $ equals the number of substrings in the string $ s $ with the length $ i $ , consisting of the same letters. The substring is a sequence of consecutive characters in the string $ s $ .
For example, if the Stepan's favorite string is equal to "tttesst", the sequence $ c $ looks like: $ c=[7,3,1,0,0,0,0] $ .
Stepan asks you to help to repair his favorite string $ s $ according to the given sequence $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2000 $ ) — the length of the Stepan's favorite string.
The second line contains the sequence of integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 0<=c_{i}<=2000 $ ), where $ c_{i} $ equals the number of substrings of the string $ s $ with the length $ i $ , consisting of the same letters.
It is guaranteed that the input data is such that the answer always exists.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the repaired Stepan's favorite string. If there are several answers, it is allowed to print any of them. The string should contain only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test Stepan's favorite string, for example, can be the string "kkrrrq", because it contains $ 6 $ substrings with the length $ 1 $ , consisting of identical letters (they begin in positions $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 6 $ ), $ 3 $ substrings with the length $ 2 $ , consisting of identical letters (they begin in positions $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ ), and $ 1 $ substring with the length $ 3 $ , consisting of identical letters (it begins in the position $ 3 $ ).</div>
