<h1>Case of Matryoshkas</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.
The main exhibit is a construction of $ n $ matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, $ 1→2→4→5 $ .
In one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:
- Having a matryoshka $ a $ that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka $ b $ , such that $ b $ doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put $ a $ in $ b $ ;
- Having a matryoshka $ a $ directly contained in matryoshka $ b $ , such that $ b $ is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get $ a $ out of $ b $ .
According to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain ( $ 1→2→...→n $ ). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.
The next $ k $ lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the $ i $ -th line first contains number $ m_{i} $ ( $ 1<=m_{i}<=n $ ), and then $ m_{i} $ numbers $ a_{i1},a_{i2},...,a_{imi} $ — the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka $ a_{i1} $ is nested into matryoshka $ a_{i2} $ , that is nested into matryoshka $ a_{i3} $ , and so on till the matryoshka $ a_{imi} $ that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).
It is guaranteed that $ m_{1}+m_{2}+...+m_{k}=n $ , the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test there are two chains: $ 1→2 $ and $ 3 $ . In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get $ 1→2→3 $ .
In the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.</div>
