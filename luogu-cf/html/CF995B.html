<h1>Suit and Tie</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Allen is hosting a formal dinner party. $ 2n $ people come to the event in $ n $ pairs (couples). After a night of fun, Allen wants to line everyone up for a final picture. The $ 2n $ people line up, but Allen doesn't like the ordering. Allen prefers if each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line, as this makes the picture more aesthetic.
Help Allen find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions he must perform to make it so that each couple occupies adjacent positions in the line.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ), the number of pairs of people.
The second line contains $ 2n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n} $ . For each $ i $ with $ 1 \le i \le n $ , $ i $ appears exactly twice. If $ a_j = a_k = i $ , that means that the $ j $ -th and $ k $ -th people in the line form a couple.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer, representing the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to line the people up so that each pair occupies adjacent positions.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, we can transform $ 1 1 2 3 3 2 4 4 \rightarrow 1 1 2 3 2 3 4 4 \rightarrow 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 $ in two steps. Note that the sequence $ 1 1 2 3 3 2 4 4 \rightarrow 1 1 3 2 3 2 4 4 \rightarrow 1 1 3 3 2 2 4 4 $ also works in the same number of steps.
The second sample case already satisfies the constraints; therefore we need $ 0 $ swaps.</div>
