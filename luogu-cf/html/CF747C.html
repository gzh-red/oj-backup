<h1>Servers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ servers in a laboratory, each of them can perform tasks. Each server has a unique id — integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
It is known that during the day $ q $ tasks will come, the $ i $ -th of them is characterized with three integers: $ t_{i} $ — the moment in seconds in which the task will come, $ k_{i} $ — the number of servers needed to perform it, and $ d_{i} $ — the time needed to perform this task in seconds. All $ t_{i} $ are distinct.
To perform the $ i $ -th task you need $ k_{i} $ servers which are unoccupied in the second $ t_{i} $ . After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next $ d_{i} $ seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds $ t_{i},t_{i}+1,...,t_{i}+d_{i}-1 $ . For performing the task, $ k_{i} $ servers with the smallest ids will be chosen from all the unoccupied servers. If in the second $ t_{i} $ there are not enough unoccupied servers, the task is ignored.
Write the program that determines which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of servers and the number of tasks.
Next $ q $ lines contains three integers each, the $ i $ -th line contains integers $ t_{i} $ , $ k_{i} $ and $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{6} $ , $ 1<=k_{i}<=n $ , $ 1<=d_{i}<=1000 $ ) — the moment in seconds in which the $ i $ -th task will come, the number of servers needed to perform it, and the time needed to perform this task in seconds. The tasks are given in a chronological order and they will come in distinct seconds.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ lines. If the $ i $ -th task will be performed by the servers, print in the $ i $ -th line the sum of servers' ids on which this task will be performed. Otherwise, print -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example in the second $ 1 $ the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ (the sum of the ids equals $ 6 $ ) during two seconds. In the second $ 2 $ the second task will come, it will be ignored, because only the server $ 4 $ will be unoccupied at that second. In the second $ 3 $ the third task will come. By this time, servers with the ids $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ will be unoccupied again, so the third task will be done on all the servers with the ids $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ (the sum of the ids is $ 10 $ ).
In the second example in the second $ 3 $ the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ (the sum of the ids is $ 3 $ ) during three seconds. In the second $ 5 $ the second task will come, it will be performed on the server $ 3 $ , because the first two servers will be busy performing the first task.</div>
