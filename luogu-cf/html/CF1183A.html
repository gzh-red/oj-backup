<h1>Nearest Interesting Number</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个$a$，求出最小的$n$，满足$n\ge a$且$n$的十进制各位数字之和能够被$4$整除。
——$\text{by wucstdio}$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $ 3 $ , then the number itself is divisible by $ 3 $ . He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $ 4 $ , are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $ n $ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $ 4 $ .
Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $ a $ . That is, find the interesting number $ n $ such that $ n \ge a $ and $ n $ is minimal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line in the input contains an integer $ a $ ( $ 1 \le a \le 1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $ a $ . In other words, print the interesting number $ n $ such that $ n \ge a $ and $ n $ is minimal.</div>
