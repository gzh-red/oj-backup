<h1>Traveling Around the Golden Ring of Berland</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
一位博主Polycarp想游览柏林的著名景点The Golden Ring.
The Golden Ring由n个城市组成为环状，城市编号由1到n。（注意：和第n个城市相连的是第一个城市和第n-1个城市）已知Polycarp想在每个城市拍几张自拍，Polycarp从第一个城市开始他的旅程，并且循环旅行，也就是说他从1城市到n城市后下一个访问的城市仍然是1城市。他每次访问一个城市至多拍一张自拍，而且循环旅行时经过的城市都要访问（无论拍不拍自拍）。
现在要求求出Polycarp的城市访问数。
## 输入格式
第一行输入一个整数n；
第二行输入n个整数a1，a2，...，an。分别代表每个城市要拍的自拍数；
保证至少有一个数严格大于0。
## 输出格式
一个整数，代表城市访问次数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Golden Ring is the special tourist route in Berland. This route consists of $ n $ cities and the cyclic railway route. Cities are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ so that:
- the next city for $ 1 $ is the city $ 2 $ ,
- the next city for $ 2 $ is the city $ 3 $ ,
- ...
- the next city for $ n $ is the city $ 1 $ .
Thus, the route is a cycle, cities are numbered in the direction of travel (the route is directed in one way).
Blogger Polycarp wants to start his journey in the city $ 1 $ . For each city he knows the value $ a_i $ — how many selfies he wants to do in $ i $ -th city. He can take no more than one selfie in one visit to each city. Since he is traveling by train, he can't skip the city (he always moves from the city $ i $ to the city $ i+1 $ for $ 1 \le i < n $ and from $ n $ to $ 1 $ ). Thus, when the train stops in the city, Polycarp must visit this city. If Polycarp visits the city multiple times, all visits are counted separately.
What is the least number of city visits Polycarp will have to complete to fulfill his plan for the number of selfies for each city? Note that he always visits the city $ 1 $ , since it is this city that his journey begins in.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5 $ ) — the number of cities in the Golden Ring of Berland.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is equal to the required number of selfies in the $ i $ -th city.
It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers $ a_i $ is strictly greater than zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the required minimum number of visits.</div>
