<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ujan has been lazy lately, but now has decided to bring his yard to good shape. First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate.
The path consists of $ n $ consecutive tiles, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Ujan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path aesthetic if for any two different tiles with numbers $ i $ and $ j $ , such that $ |j - i| $ is a divisor of $ n $ greater than $ 1 $ , they have the same color. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers $ i $ and $ j $ should be the same if $ |i-j| > 1 $ and $ n \bmod |i-j| = 0 $ (where $ x \bmod y $ is the remainder when dividing $ x $ by $ y $ ).
Ujan wants to brighten up space. What is the maximum number of different colors that Ujan can use, so that the path is aesthetic?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^{12} $ ), the length of the path.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer, the maximum possible number of colors that the path can be painted in.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, two colors is the maximum number. Tiles $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ should have the same color since $ 4 \bmod |3-1| = 0 $ . Also, tiles $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ should have the same color since $ 4 \bmod |4-2| = 0 $ .
In the second sample, all five colors can be used.
