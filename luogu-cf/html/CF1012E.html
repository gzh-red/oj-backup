<h1>Cycle sort</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>您将获得一组n个正整数a1到an，您可以多次执行以下操作：选择多个不同的索引i1...ik(i<=ij<=n)，并移动位于i1位置的数字
到i2的位置,位于i2位置的数字到位置i3,...,位置ik的数字到位置i1。换句话说，操作循环移位元素：i1→i2→.... ik→i1.
例如，如果n = 4,则数组a1=10,a2=20,a3=30,a4=40,然后你选择三个指数i1=2,i2=1,i3=4,然后得到的数组将变为a1=20,a2=40,a3=30,a4=10.
您的目标是使用最少的操作数使数组按非递减顺序排序。附加约束是所有操作的周期长度之和应小于或等于数ss。如果在满足该约束的同时对阵列进行排序是不可能的，那么您的解决方案也应该报告。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array of $ n $ positive integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ . You can perform the following operation any number of times: select several distinct indices $ i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k $ ( $ 1 \le i_j \le n $ ) and move the number standing at the position $ i_1 $ to the position $ i_2 $ , the number at the position $ i_2 $ to the position $ i_3 $ , ..., the number at the position $ i_k $ to the position $ i_1 $ . In other words, the operation cyclically shifts elements: $ i_1 \to i_2 \to \ldots i_k \to i_1 $ .
For example, if you have $ n=4 $ , an array $ a_1=10, a_2=20, a_3=30, a_4=40 $ , and you choose three indices $ i_1=2 $ , $ i_2=1 $ , $ i_3=4 $ , then the resulting array would become $ a_1=20, a_2=40, a_3=30, a_4=10 $ .
Your goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order with the minimum number of operations. The additional constraint is that the sum of cycle lengths over all operations should be less than or equal to a number $ s $ . If it's impossible to sort the array while satisfying that constraint, your solution should report that as well.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ s $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 200\,000 $ , $ 0 \leq s \leq 200\,000 $ )—the number of elements in the array and the upper bound on the sum of cycle lengths.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ —elements of the array ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it's impossible to sort the array using cycles of total length not exceeding $ s $ , print a single number "-1" (quotes for clarity).
Otherwise, print a single number $ q $ — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array.
On the next $ 2 \cdot q $ lines print descriptions of operations in the order they are applied to the array. The description of $ i $ -th operation begins with a single line containing one integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le n $ )—the length of the cycle (that is, the number of selected indices). The next line should contain $ k $ distinct integers $ i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k $ ( $ 1 \le i_j \le n $ )—the indices of the cycle.
The sum of lengths of these cycles should be less than or equal to $ s $ , and the array should be sorted after applying these $ q $ operations.
If there are several possible answers with the optimal $ q $ , print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, it's also possible to sort the array with two operations of total length 5: first apply the cycle $ 1 \to 4 \to 1 $ (of length 2), then apply the cycle $ 2 \to 3 \to 5 \to 2 $ (of length 3). However, it would be wrong answer as you're asked to use the minimal possible number of operations, which is 1 in that case.
In the second example, it's possible to the sort the array with two cycles of total length 4 ( $ 1 \to 2 \to 1 $ and $ 3 \to 4 \to 3 $ ). However, it's impossible to achieve the same using shorter cycles, which is required by $ s=3 $ .
In the third example, the array is already sorted, so no operations are needed. Total length of empty set of cycles is considered to be zero.</div>
