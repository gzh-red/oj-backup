<h1>Nearest Fraction</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你x、y、n(1~1e5)，找到一个分母不大于n且与x-y最接近的分数，若有多个求分母最小的，若分母最小有多个求分子最小的</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given three positive integers $ x,y,n $ . Your task is to find the nearest fraction to fraction ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF281B/4ac5ad94fb5392cd96ac09e5b84eb06e8c8a0edb.png) whose denominator is no more than $ n $ .
Formally, you should find such pair of integers $ a,b $ $ (1<=b<=n; 0<=a) $ that the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF281B/c829c21e70460346cb0c98e0e40815418eed87ca.png) is as minimal as possible.
If there are multiple "nearest" fractions, choose the one with the minimum denominator. If there are multiple "nearest" fractions with the minimum denominator, choose the one with the minimum numerator.</div>
