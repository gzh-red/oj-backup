<h1>Lucky Interval</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
One day Petya came across an interval of numbers $ [a,a+l-1] $ . Let $ F(x) $ be the number of lucky digits of number $ x $ . Find the minimum $ b $ $ (a&lt;b) $ such, that $ F(a) $ = $ F(b) $ , $ F(a+1) $ = $ F(b+1) $ , ..., $ F(a+l-1) $ = $ F(b+l-1) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers $ a $ and $ l $ ( $ 1<=a,l<=10^{9} $ ) — the interval's first number and the interval's length correspondingly.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the single line print number $ b $ — the answer to the problem.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider that $ [a,b] $ denotes an interval of integers; this interval includes the boundaries. That is, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF109E/3baf0964dff89707940ee601b97374ef5d1c102f.png)</div>
