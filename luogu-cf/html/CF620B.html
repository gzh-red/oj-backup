<h1>Grandfather Dovlet’s calculator</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Once Max found an electronic calculator from his grandfather Dovlet's chest. He noticed that the numbers were written with seven-segment indicators ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment\_display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display)).
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF620B/67b24c9a2393a33eff16b95f90d96d29b0d56e85.png)Max starts to type all the values from $ a $ to $ b $ . After typing each number Max resets the calculator. Find the total number of segments printed on the calculator.
For example if $ a=1 $ and $ b=3 $ then at first the calculator will print $ 2 $ segments, then — $ 5 $ segments and at last it will print $ 5 $ segments. So the total number of printed segments is $ 12 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
