<h1>Numbers Exchange</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>尤金有n张卡片，每张卡片上都有一个整数。尤金希望与尼古拉交换一些卡片，使得他的偶数卡片的数量等于奇数卡片的数量，并且所有卡片上的数字不相同。
尼古拉有m张卡，上面的数字为1到m，也就是每个数的卡片各一张。
每次两人可以交换一张卡，问最少交换几次可以满足尤金的要求。
$1≤n≤2×10^5,1≤m,a_i≤10^9$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Eugeny has $ n $ cards, each of them has exactly one integer written on it. Eugeny wants to exchange some cards with Nikolay so that the number of even integers on his cards would equal the number of odd integers, and that all these numbers would be distinct.
Nikolay has $ m $ cards, distinct numbers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ are written on them, one per card. It means that Nikolay has exactly one card with number $ 1 $ , exactly one card with number $ 2 $ and so on.
A single exchange is a process in which Eugeny gives one card to Nikolay and takes another one from those Nikolay has. Your task is to find the minimum number of card exchanges and determine which cards Eugeny should exchange.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5} $ , $ 1<=m<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of cards Eugeny has and the number of cards Nikolay has. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is even.
The second line contains a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the numbers on Eugeny's cards.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no answer, print -1.
Otherwise, in the first line print the minimum number of exchanges. In the second line print $ n $ integers — Eugeny's cards after all the exchanges with Nikolay. The order of cards should coincide with the card's order in the input data. If the $ i $ -th card wasn't exchanged then the $ i $ -th number should coincide with the number from the input data. Otherwise, it is considered that this card was exchanged, and the $ i $ -th number should be equal to the number on the card it was exchanged to.
If there are multiple answers, it is allowed to print any of them.</div>
