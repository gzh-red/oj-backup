<h1>Little Girl and Problem on Trees</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一棵无边权的树，有两种操作
1）（0 v x d）将距离u节点d距离之内的节点的值加上x
2）（1 v）询问u节点的值
n<=100000,q<=100000</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A little girl loves problems on trees very much. Here's one of them.
A tree is an undirected connected graph, not containing cycles. The degree of node $ x $ in the tree is the number of nodes $ y $ of the tree, such that each of them is connected with node $ x $ by some edge of the tree.
Let's consider a tree that consists of $ n $ nodes. We'll consider the tree's nodes indexed from 1 to $ n $ . The cosidered tree has the following property: each node except for node number 1 has the degree of at most 2.
Initially, each node of the tree contains number 0. Your task is to quickly process the requests of two types:
- Request of form: $ 0 $ $ v $ $ x $ $ d $ . In reply to the request you should add $ x $ to all numbers that are written in the nodes that are located at the distance of at most $ d $ from node $ v $ . The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the shortest path between them.
- Request of form: $ 1 $ $ v $ . In reply to the request you should print the current number that is written in node $ v $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) and $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of tree nodes and the number of requests, correspondingly.
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ , $ u_{i}≠v_{i} $ ), that show that there is an edge between nodes $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ . Each edge's description occurs in the input exactly once. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree that has the property that is described in the statement.
Next $ q $ lines describe the requests.
- The request to add has the following format: $ 0 $ $ v $ $ x $ $ d $ ( $ 1<=v<=n $ , $ 1<=x<=10^{4} $ , $ 1<=d&lt;n $ ).
- The request to print the node value has the following format: $ 1 $ $ v $ ( $ 1<=v<=n $ ).
The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each request to print the node value print an integer — the reply to the request.</div>
