<h1>Memory and Trident</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Memory从二维坐标系的原点出发,按字符串s的指示运动
R:向右;L:向左;U:向上;D:向下
Memory最终想回到原点,问至少需要改变字符串s中的几个字符
若无论如何改变都无法回到原点,输出"-1"</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Memory is performing a walk on the two-dimensional plane, starting at the origin. He is given a string $ s $ with his directions for motion:
- An 'L' indicates he should move one unit left.
- An 'R' indicates he should move one unit right.
- A 'U' indicates he should move one unit up.
- A 'D' indicates he should move one unit down.
But now Memory wants to end at the origin. To do this, he has a special trident. This trident can replace any character in $ s $ with any of 'L', 'R', 'U', or 'D'. However, because he doesn't want to wear out the trident, he wants to make the minimum number of edits possible. Please tell Memory what is the minimum number of changes he needs to make to produce a string that, when walked, will end at the origin, or if there is no such string.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=100000 $ ) — the instructions Memory is given.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is a string satisfying the conditions, output a single integer — the minimum number of edits required. In case it's not possible to change the sequence in such a way that it will bring Memory to to the origin, output -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>RRU
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>-1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>UDUR
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>RUUR
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test, Memory is told to walk right, then right, then up. It is easy to see that it is impossible to edit these instructions to form a valid walk.
In the second sample test, Memory is told to walk up, then down, then up, then right. One possible solution is to change $ s $ to "LDUR". This string uses 1 edit, which is the minimum possible. It also ends at the origin.</div>
