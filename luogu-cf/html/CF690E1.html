<h1>Photographs (I)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Human-Cow Confederation ( $ HC^{2} $ ), led by Heidi, has built a base where people and cows can hide, guarded from zombie attacks. The entrance to the base is protected by an automated gate which performs a kind of a Turing test: it shows the entering creature a photograph and asks them whether the top and bottom halves of this photograph have been swapped or not. A person (or even a cow) will have no problem answering such questions; on the other hand, a zombie would just randomly smash one of the two buttons.
The creature is asked a series of such questions. If at least $ 75% $ of them are answered correctly, the gate is unlocked; otherwise, a side door opens, beneath which a huge fan is spinning...
Heidi is now building a robot army to fight the zombies, and she wants the robots to also be able to enter the base. You are tasked with programming them to distinguish the images.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains the number $ q $ of questions ( $ 1<=q<=220 $ ). After that, $ q $ questions follow, each of which in the format described below.
The first line of every question contains two space-separated integers $ h $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=h,w<=600 $ ) – the height (number of rows) and width (number of columns) of the photograph. (Most photographs are roughly $ 200×300 $ .) After this, $ h $ lines follow, each describing a single row of the picture. The picture is monochrome (in shades of grey). Its $ i $ -th row is described by $ w $ space-separated integers $ a_{ij} $ ( $ j=1,...,w $ ), where $ a_{ij} $ is the brightness of the corresponding pixel ( $ 0<=a_{ij}<256 $ , where $ 0 $ is black and $ 255 $ is white).
Each picture will be either a real-life photograph, or a real-life photograph which has been broken up into two pieces and rearranged. More precisely, in the latter case, the topmost ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF690E1/568e61a98a42ddbec25913a1d27f1db5aeb559a8.png) rows have been moved to the bottom of the picture. It is guaranteed that $ h $ is even.
There is only a single input file to be processed, called all.in, and it is downloadable from the online judge. You are also a given another input file, called sample.in, which contains the first $ 20 $ pictures from all.in; you are provided the correct answers for sample.in in sample.out. You are also given a directory easy\_bmp, which contains the first 50 input photographs in the form of .bmp image files, as well as a directory easy\_sample\_original\_bmp, which contains the first $ 20 $ images before rearrangement. Check the notes for the download links.</div>
