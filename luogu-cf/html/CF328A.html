<h1>IQ Test</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目翻译
Petya在为一个智力测试做准备，这个智力测试会给你一个序列，而如果它是一个等差数列或是一个等比数列，则要求你输出这个序列的下一项。否则输出42
输入格式
一行，为该序列（该序列中的所有数均为1到1000的整数）
输出格式
一个整数，即该序列的下一项（答案可能为负数）或42</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya is preparing for IQ test and he has noticed that there many problems like: you are given a sequence, find the next number. Now Petya can solve only problems with arithmetic or geometric progressions.
Arithmetic progression is a sequence $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{1}+d $ , $ a_{1}+2d $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{1}+(n-1)d $ , where $ a_{1} $ and $ d $ are any numbers.
Geometric progression is a sequence $ b_{1} $ , $ b_{2}=b_{1}q $ , $ ... $ , $ b_{n}=b_{n-1}q $ , where $ b_{1}≠0 $ , $ q≠0 $ , $ q≠1 $ .
Help Petya and write a program to determine if the given sequence is arithmetic or geometric. Also it should found the next number. If the sequence is neither arithmetic nor geometric, print 42 (he thinks it is impossible to find better answer). You should also print 42 if the next element of progression is not integer. So answer is always integer.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains exactly four integer numbers between 1 and 1000, inclusively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the required number. If the given sequence is arithmetic progression, print the next progression element. Similarly, if the given sequence is geometric progression, print the next progression element.
Print 42 if the given sequence is not an arithmetic or geometric progression.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>836 624 412 200
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>-12
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1 334 667 1000
