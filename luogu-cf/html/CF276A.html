<h1>Lunch Rush</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Having written another programming contest, three Rabbits decided to grab some lunch. The coach gave the team exactly $ k $ time units for the lunch break.
The Rabbits have a list of $ n $ restaurants to lunch in: the $ i $ -th restaurant is characterized by two integers $ f_{i} $ and $ t_{i} $ . Value $ t_{i} $ shows the time the Rabbits need to lunch in the $ i $ -th restaurant. If time $ t_{i} $ exceeds the time $ k $ that the coach has given for the lunch break, then the Rabbits' joy from lunching in this restaurant will equal $ f_{i}-(t_{i}-k) $ . Otherwise, the Rabbits get exactly $ f_{i} $ units of joy.
Your task is to find the value of the maximum joy the Rabbits can get from the lunch, depending on the restaurant. The Rabbits must choose exactly one restaurant to lunch in. Note that the joy value isn't necessarily a positive value.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers — $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{4} $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of restaurants in the Rabbits' list and the time the coach has given them to lunch, correspondingly. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two space-separated integers — $ f_{i} $ ( $ 1<=f_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) and $ t_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the characteristics of the $ i $ -th restaurant.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
