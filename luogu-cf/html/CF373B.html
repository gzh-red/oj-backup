<h1>Making Sequences is Fun</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We'll define $ S(n) $ for positive integer $ n $ as follows: the number of the $ n $ 's digits in the decimal base. For example, $ S(893)=3 $ , $ S(114514)=6 $ .
You want to make a consecutive integer sequence starting from number $ m $ ( $ m,m+1,... $ ). But you need to pay $ S(n)·k $ to add the number $ n $ to the sequence.
You can spend a cost up to $ w $ , and you want to make the sequence as long as possible. Write a program that tells sequence's maximum length.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ w $ ( $ 1<=w<=10^{16} $ ), $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=10^{16} $ ), $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ).
Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line should contain a single integer — the answer to the problem.</div>
