<h1>Nested Segments</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在数轴上给出n个区间，用（L,R）表示。保证所有的L、R互不相同，对于每一个区间，求出它能包含多少个已给出的区间（不包括他自己）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ segments on a line. There are no ends of some segments that coincide. For each segment find the number of segments it contains.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of segments on a line.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=l_{i}&lt;r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the left and the right ends of the $ i $ -th segment. It is guaranteed that there are no ends of some segments that coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ lines. The $ j $ -th of them should contain the only integer $ a_{j} $ — the number of segments contained in the $ j $ -th segment.</div>
