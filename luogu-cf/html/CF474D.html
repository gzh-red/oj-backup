<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>话说某个幸运的小伙伴X拿到了kevin女神送的蛋糕，然而他的吃法非常奇特，他独创了两种吃蛋糕的办法：一、一次吃一整个蛋糕；二、一次吃k个蛋糕。 那么，当蛋糕数量为x1到x2之间时，一共能有几种不同的吃法呢？ 由于答案很大，输出结果mod 1000000007的值
感谢 @转身、已陌路 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We saw the little game Marmot made for Mole's lunch. Now it's Marmot's dinner time and, as we all know, Marmot eats flowers. At every dinner he eats some red and white flowers. Therefore a dinner can be represented as a sequence of several flowers, some of them white and some of them red.
But, for a dinner to be tasty, there is a rule: Marmot wants to eat white flowers only in groups of size $ k $ .
Now Marmot wonders in how many ways he can eat between $ a $ and $ b $ flowers. As the number of ways could be very large, print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>
