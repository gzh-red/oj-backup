<h1>Important Exam</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$n(1 \le n \le 1000)$个学生在考试，共有$m(1 \le m \le 1000$)道单选题，每道单选题的待选项均为$ABCDE$，每道单选题的分值为$a_{i}(1 \le a_{i} \le 1000)$。现在给出第$i$个学生的作答$s_{i}($保证$s_{i}$的长度为$m$，且每道单选题均已作答$)$，$s_{i}$的第$j$个字母代表学生$i$在第$j$个选择题的作答选项。
求$n$个学生的总分的最大值是多少。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A class of students wrote a multiple-choice test.
There are $ n $ students in the class. The test had $ m $ questions, each of them had $ 5 $ possible answers (A, B, C, D or E). There is exactly one correct answer for each question. The correct answer for question $ i $ worth $ a_i $ points. Incorrect answers are graded with zero points.
The students remember what answers they gave on the exam, but they don't know what are the correct answers. They are very optimistic, so they want to know what is the maximum possible total score of all students in the class.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 1000 $ ) — the number of students in the class and the number of questions in the test.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains string $ s_i $ ( $ |s_i| = m $ ), describing an answer of the $ i $ -th student. The $ j $ -th character represents the student answer (A, B, C, D or E) on the $ j $ -th question.
The last line contains $ m $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 1000 $ ) — the number of points for the correct answer for every question.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible total score of the class.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
2 4
ABCD
ABCE
1 2 3 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
16</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
3 3
ABC
BCD
CDE
5 4 12
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
21</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, one of the most optimal test answers is "ABCD", this way the total number of points will be $ 16 $ .
In the second example, one of the most optimal test answers is "CCC", this way each question will be answered by exactly one student and the total number of points is $ 5 + 4 + 12 = 21 $ .</div>
