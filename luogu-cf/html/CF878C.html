<h1>Tournament</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>最近Berland开始了一场有k种运动的比赛。瓦萨亚希望在赌场上赚钱。
比赛的计划非常神秘，并没有完全公开。比赛选手背靠背举行，每场比赛都涉及两名尚未淘汰的运动员。每场比赛都可以举行k种运动里的任意一种，失败者则遭到淘汰。最后剩下的运动员成为冠军。除此之外，该方案可以是任意的，不提前公开。
瓦西亚了解各种运动中的运动员的力量。他认为，拥有更高力量的运动员总能获胜。
比赛每年举行一次，每年都有一名新参赛者加入比赛。在第一场比赛中，只有一名运动员参加，第二场比赛有两名运动员，依此类推。
请你帮助他找到每一年可能获得冠军的人数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently a tournament in $ k $ kinds of sports has begun in Berland. Vasya wants to make money on the bets.

Apart of this, the scheme can be arbitrary, it is not disclosed in advance.

<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=5·10^{4} $ , $ 1<=k<=10 $ ) — the number of tournaments and the number of kinds of sport, respectively.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ k $ integers $ s_{i1},s_{i2},...,s_{ik} $ ( $ 1<=s_{ij}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ s_{ij} $ is the power of the $ i $ -th sportsman in the $ j $ -th kind of sport. The sportsman with higher powers always wins. It's guaranteed that for any kind of sport all of these powers are distinct.</div>
