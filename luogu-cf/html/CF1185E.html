<h1>Polycarp and Snakes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题意简述
t组数据，每次给出一个n*m的矩阵，
你可以每次按照字母顺序添加横向或纵向的一条链，这条链会是a~z26个小写字母中的一个，并且会覆盖原来的链。
现在给出一个操作后的矩阵，
要求回答是否可能形成这种情况，
且每条链是从哪个点到哪个点。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After a hard-working week Polycarp prefers to have fun. Polycarp's favorite entertainment is drawing snakes. He takes a rectangular checkered sheet of paper of size $ n \times m $ (where $ n $ is the number of rows, $ m $ is the number of columns) and starts to draw snakes in cells.
Polycarp draws snakes with lowercase Latin letters. He always draws the first snake with the symbol 'a', the second snake with the symbol 'b', the third snake with the symbol 'c' and so on. All snakes have their own unique symbol. There are only $ 26 $ letters in the Latin alphabet, Polycarp is very tired and he doesn't want to invent new symbols, so the total number of drawn snakes doesn't exceed $ 26 $ .
Since by the end of the week Polycarp is very tired, he draws snakes as straight lines without bends. So each snake is positioned either vertically or horizontally. Width of any snake equals $ 1 $ , i.e. each snake has size either $ 1 \times l $ or $ l \times 1 $ , where $ l $ is snake's length. Note that snakes can't bend.
When Polycarp draws a new snake, he can use already occupied cells for drawing the snake. In this situation, he draws the snake "over the top" and overwrites the previous value in the cell.
Recently when Polycarp was at work he found a checkered sheet of paper with Latin letters. He wants to know if it is possible to get this sheet of paper from an empty sheet by drawing some snakes according to the rules described above. If it is possible, he is interested in a way to draw snakes.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of test cases to solve. Then $ t $ test cases follow.
The first line of the test case description contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n,m \le 2000 $ ) — length and width of the checkered sheet of paper respectively.
Next $ n $ lines of test case description contain $ m $ symbols, which are responsible for the content of the corresponding cell on the sheet. It can be either lowercase Latin letter or symbol dot ('.'), which stands for an empty cell.
It is guaranteed that the total area of all sheets in one test doesn't exceed $ 4\cdot10^6 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the answer for each test case in the input.
In the first line of the output for a test case print YES if it is possible to draw snakes, so that you can get a sheet of paper from the input. If it is impossible, print NO.
If the answer to this question is positive, then print the way to draw snakes in the following format. In the next line print one integer $ k $ ( $ 0 \le k \le 26 $ ) — number of snakes. Then print $ k $ lines, in each line print four integers $ r_{1,i} $ , $ c_{1,i} $ , $ r_{2,i} $ and $ c_{2,i} $ — coordinates of extreme cells for the $ i $ -th snake ( $ 1 \le r_{1,i}, r_{2,i} \le n $ , $ 1 \le c_{1,i}, c_{2,i} \le m $ ). Snakes should be printed in order of their drawing. If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.
Note that Polycarp starts drawing of snakes with an empty sheet of paper.</div>
