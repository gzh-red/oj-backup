<h1>Jzzhu and Chocolate</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个N * M的矩阵，给K个操作，每次操作可以横/竖切割矩阵，最后求K次切割之后，矩阵最小的那块面积最大是多少？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jzzhu has a big rectangular chocolate bar that consists of $ n×m $ unit squares. He wants to cut this bar exactly $ k $ times. Each cut must meet the following requirements:
- each cut should be straight (horizontal or vertical);
- each cut should go along edges of unit squares (it is prohibited to divide any unit chocolate square with cut);
- each cut should go inside the whole chocolate bar, and all cuts must be distinct.
The picture below shows a possible way to cut a $ 5×6 $ chocolate for $ 5 $ times.

Consider the smallest (by area) piece of the chocolate, Jzzhu wants this piece to be as large as possible. What is the maximum possible area of smallest piece he can get with exactly $ k $ cuts? The area of a chocolate piece is the number of unit squares in it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{9}; 1<=k<=2·10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer representing the answer. If it is impossible to cut the big chocolate $ k $ times, print -1.</div>
