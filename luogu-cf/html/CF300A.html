<h1>Array</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Vitaly准备把一个n个元素的序列放进三个集合中，满足以下条件：
1.第一个集合里所有元素的乘积小于0
2.第二个集合里所有元素的乘积大于0
3.第三个集合里所有元素的乘积等于0
求一个满足条件的方案
输出格式：
三行，每行表示第几个集合，第一个数为集合里元素个数，后面的数为集合里的元素。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vitaly has an array of $ n $ distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold:
1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero $ (<0) $ .
2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero $ (>0) $ .
3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero.
4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set.
Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=100) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (|a_{i}|<=10^{3}) $ — the array elements.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print integer $ n_{1} $ $ (n_{1}>0) $ — the number of elements in the first set. Then print $ n_{1} $ numbers — the elements that got to the first set.
In the next line print integer $ n_{2} $ $ (n_{2}>0) $ — the number of elements in the second set. Then print $ n_{2} $ numbers — the elements that got to the second set.
In the next line print integer $ n_{3} $ $ (n_{3}>0) $ — the number of elements in the third set. Then print $ n_{3} $ numbers — the elements that got to the third set.
The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
