<h1>Design Tutorial: Learn from Math</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一个数n(12<=n<=10^6)，找出两个合数x,y，使得x+y=n,如果有多组x,y,输出任意一组即可
【输入格式】：一个数，n
【输出格式】：两个数，中间用空格隔开，任意一组满足题意的x和y </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random math statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new task from that.
For example, there is a statement called the "Goldbach's conjecture". It says: "each even number no less than four can be expressed as the sum of two primes". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that: "each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers." Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem.
You are given an integer $ n $ no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains an integer $ n $ $ (12<=n<=10^{6}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output two composite integers $ x $ and $ y $ $ (1<x,y<n) $ such that $ x+y=n $ . If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>12
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 8
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>15
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6 9
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>23
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>8 15
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>1000000
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #4</h3>
<pre><code>500000 500000
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are composite numbers. You can output "6 6" or "8 4" as well.
In the second example, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output "1 14" because 1 is not a composite number.</div>
