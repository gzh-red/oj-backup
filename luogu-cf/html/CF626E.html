<h1>Simple Skewness</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意:从n个数中选一些数,使得这些数的平均数减去中位数最大</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Define the simple skewness of a collection of numbers to be the collection's mean minus its median. You are given a list of $ n $ (not necessarily distinct) integers. Find the non-empty subset (with repetition) with the maximum simple skewness.
The mean of a collection is the average of its elements. The median of a collection is its middle element when all of its elements are sorted, or the average of its two middle elements if it has even size.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200\ 000 $ ) — the number of elements in the list.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{i} $ ( $ 0<=x_{i}<=1000000 $ ) — the $ i $ th element of the list.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, print a single integer $ k $ — the size of the subset.
In the second line, print $ k $ integers — the elements of the subset in any order.
If there are multiple optimal subsets, print any.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case, the optimal subset is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF626E/0b9550a7a9f20f7b56fdc9073fe6e2b4a2093ee5.png), which has mean $ 5 $ , median $ 2 $ , and simple skewness of $ 5-2=3 $ .
In the second case, the optimal subset is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF626E/d0a3a979416d48c43b3c8a042caaf404373f99fe.png). Note that repetition is allowed.
In the last case, any subset has the same median and mean, so all have simple skewness of $ 0 $ .</div>
