<h1>Splitting into digits</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数字$n$,请将它拆分成$a_1+a_2+\cdots + a_m,a_i \in [1,9]$,使得$\sum_{i=1}^ma_i = n$,并且使$a_i$中不同的数尽量少
输出方案,两行，第一行为数的个数$m$，第二行为$m$个数，由空格隔开，分别为$a_1 - a_m$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has his favourite number $ n $ . He wants to split it to some non-zero digits. It means, that he wants to choose some digits $ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k $ , such that $ 1 \leq d_i \leq 9 $ for all $ i $ and $ d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_k = n $ .
Vasya likes beauty in everything, so he wants to find any solution with the minimal possible number of different digits among $ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k $ . Help him!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ — the number that Vasya wants to split ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print one integer $ k $ — the number of digits in the partition. Note that $ k $ must satisfy the inequality $ 1 \leq k \leq n $ . In the next line print $ k $ digits $ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k $ separated by spaces. All digits must satisfy the inequalities $ 1 \leq d_i \leq 9 $ .
You should find a partition of $ n $ in which the number of different digits among $ d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k $ will be minimal possible among all partitions of $ n $ into non-zero digits. Among such partitions, it is allowed to find any. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one partition of the number $ n $ into digits.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test, the number $ 1 $ can be divided into $ 1 $ digit equal to $ 1 $ .
In the second test, there are $ 3 $ partitions of the number $ 4 $ into digits in which the number of different digits is $ 1 $ . This partitions are $ [1, 1, 1, 1] $ , $ [2, 2] $ and $ [4] $ . Any of these partitions can be found. And, for example, dividing the number $ 4 $ to the digits $ [1, 1, 2] $ isn't an answer, because it has $ 2 $ different digits, that isn't the minimum possible number.</div>
