<h1>Two Arithmetic Progressions</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>已知$x$ $mod$ $a_{1}=b_{1}$，$x$ $mod$ $a_{2}=b_{2}$，求在$[l,r]$之间有多少个解。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two arithmetic progressions: $ a_{1}k+b_{1} $ and $ a_{2}l+b_{2} $ . Find the number of integers $ x $ such that $ L<=x<=R $ and $ x=a_{1}k'+b_{1}=a_{2}l'+b_{2} $ , for some integers $ k',l'>=0 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains six integers $ a_{1},b_{1},a_{2},b_{2},L,R $ ( $ 0&lt;a_{1},a_{2}<=2·10^{9},-2·10^{9}<=b_{1},b_{2},L,R<=2·10^{9},L<=R $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the desired number of integers $ x $ .</div>
