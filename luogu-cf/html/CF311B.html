<div>题目描述
Zxr960115 是一个大农场主。他养了m只可爱的猫子,雇佣了p个铲屎官。这里有一条又直又长的道路穿过了农场，有n个山丘坐落在道路周围，编号自左往右从1到n。山丘i与山丘i-1的距离是Di米。铲屎官们住在1号山丘。
一天，猫子们外出玩耍。猫子i去山丘Hi游玩，在Ti时间结束他的游玩，然后在山丘Hi傻等铲屎官。铲屎官们必须把所有的猫子带上。每个铲屎官直接从H1走到Hn，中间不停下，可以认为不花费时间的把游玩结束的猫子带上。每个铲屎官的速度为一米每单位时间，并且足够强壮来带上任意数量的猫子。
举个栗子，假装我们有两个山丘(D2=1)，有一只猫子，他想去山丘2玩到时间3。然后嘞铲屎官如果在时间2或者时间3从1号山丘出发，他就能抱走猫子。如果他在时间1出发那么就不行(猫子还在玩耍)。如果铲屎官在时间2出发，猫子就不用等他（ΔT=0）。如果他在时间3出发，猫子就要等他1个单位时间。
你的任务是安排每个铲屎官出发的时间，最小化猫子们等待的时间之和。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Zxr960115 is owner of a large farm. He feeds $ m $ cute cats and employs $ p $ feeders. There's a straight road across the farm and $ n $ hills along the road, numbered from 1 to $ n $ from left to right. The distance between hill $ i $ and $ (i-1) $ is $ d_{i} $ meters. The feeders live in hill 1.
One day, the cats went out to play. Cat $ i $ went on a trip to hill $ h_{i} $ , finished its trip at time $ t_{i} $ , and then waited at hill $ h_{i} $ for a feeder. The feeders must take all the cats. Each feeder goes straightly from hill 1 to $ n $ without waiting at a hill and takes all the waiting cats at each hill away. Feeders walk at a speed of 1 meter per unit time and are strong enough to take as many cats as they want.
For example, suppose we have two hills $ (d_{2}=1) $ and one cat that finished its trip at time 3 at hill 2 $ (h_{1}=2) $ . Then if the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 2 or at time 3, he can take this cat, but if he leaves hill 1 at time 1 he can't take it. If the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 2, the cat waits him for 0 time units, if the feeder leaves hill 1 at time 3, the cat waits him for 1 time units.
Your task is to schedule the time leaving from hill 1 for each feeder so that the sum of the waiting time of all cats is minimized.</div>
