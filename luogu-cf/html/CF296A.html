<h1>Yaroslav and Permutations</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有一个数组，现在你要在有限的次数内移动相邻的两个数，最后是否能使数组中没有数字相同的相邻元素。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Yaroslav has an array that consists of $ n $ integers. In one second Yaroslav can swap two neighboring array elements. Now Yaroslav is wondering if he can obtain an array where any two neighboring elements would be distinct in a finite time.
Help Yaroslav.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=100) $ — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=1000) $ — the array elements.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if Yaroslav can obtain the array he needs, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1

</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>YES

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>4
7 7 7 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the initial array fits well.
In the second sample Yaroslav can get array: $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 1 $ . He can swap the last and the second last elements to obtain it.
In the third sample Yarosav can't get the array he needs.</div>
