<h1>Sum of Medians</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>```cpp
一个集合，初始为空。现有三个操作：
1.add：向集合里加入数x，保证加入前集合中没有数x；
2.del：从集合中删除数x，保证删除前集合中有x；
3.sum：询问将集合里的数从小到大排序后，求下标i模5余3的数的和。
现有n次操作，对于每个查询操作，输出答案
```

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In one well-known algorithm of finding the $ k $ -th order statistics we should divide all elements into groups of five consecutive elements and find the median of each five. A median is called the middle element of a sorted array (it's the third largest element for a group of five). To increase the algorithm's performance speed on a modern video card, you should be able to find a sum of medians in each five of the array.
A sum of medians of a sorted $ k $ -element set $ S={a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k}} $ , where $ a_{1}&lt;a_{2}&lt;a_{3}&lt;...&lt;a_{k} $ , will be understood by as
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/ade3397df6e8978ddadfc100b4ccb88beefd1e3f.png)The ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/99fd5677ca5c02520be7595d9b1eaf3e9972e601.png) operator stands for taking the remainder, that is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF85D/cb1d84ad58154eb7ea26b65d1ae0039570db9bb6.png) stands for the remainder of dividing $ x $ by $ y $ .
To organize exercise testing quickly calculating the sum of medians for a changing set was needed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ), the number of operations performed.
Then each of $ n $ lines contains the description of one of the three operations:
- add $ x $ — add the element $ x $ to the set;
- del $ x $ — delete the element $ x $ from the set;
- sum — find the sum of medians of the set.
For any add $ x $ operation it is true that the element $ x $ is not included in the set directly before the operation.
For any del $ x $ operation it is true that the element $ x $ is included in the set directly before the operation.
All the numbers in the input are positive integers, not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each operation sum print on the single line the sum of medians of the current set. If the set is empty, print 0.
Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams (also you may use the %I64d specificator).</div>
