<h1>Lucky Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义幸运数为只含有$4$和$7$的数。例如: $47$, $744$, $4$ 是幸运数，而 $5$, $17$, $467$ 不是幸运数。
给定包含$n$个整数的序列$a$，试求从$a$中取出$k$个数组成一个子序列的方案数。
$a$中的数可能重复，只要位置不同就看做不同的方案。同时要求神仙数只能取用至多一次，非神仙数可以取用多次。
答案对 $10^9 + 7$ 取模。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya has sequence $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers.
The subsequence of the sequence $ a $ is such subsequence that can be obtained from $ a $ by removing zero or more of its elements.
Two sequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, any sequence of length $ n $ has exactly $ 2^{n} $ different subsequences (including an empty subsequence).
A subsequence is considered lucky if it has a length exactly $ k $ and does not contain two identical lucky numbers (unlucky numbers can be repeated any number of times).
Help Petya find the number of different lucky subsequences of the sequence $ a $ . As Petya's parents don't let him play with large numbers, you should print the result modulo prime number $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=k<=n<=10^{5}) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the sequence $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the single line print the single number — the answer to the problem modulo prime number $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample all $ 3 $ subsequences of the needed length are considered lucky.
In the second sample there are $ 4 $ lucky subsequences. For them the sets of indexes equal (the indexation starts from $ 1 $ ): $ {1,3} $ , $ {1,4} $ , $ {2,3} $ and $ {2,4} $ .</div>
