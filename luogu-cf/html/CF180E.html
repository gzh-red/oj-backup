<h1>Cubes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's imagine that you're playing the following simple computer game. The screen displays $ n $ lined-up cubes. Each cube is painted one of $ m $ colors. You are allowed to delete not more than $ k $ cubes (that do not necessarily go one after another). After that, the remaining cubes join together (so that the gaps are closed) and the system counts the score. The number of points you score equals to the length of the maximum sequence of cubes of the same color that follow consecutively. Write a program that determines the maximum possible number of points you can score.
Remember, you may delete no more than $ k $ any cubes. It is allowed not to delete cubes at all.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5},1<=m<=10^{5},0<=k&lt;n $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ — the numbers of cube colors. The numbers of colors are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible number of points you can score.</div>
