<h1>Perfect Pair</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意：定义一对数(x,y)，若x、y中至少有一个大于等于m，则称(x,y)对m完美。
现在给定一对数(x,y)，允许把其中的一个数换成x+y，问把(x,y)变成对m完美的数对至少需要几次操作。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let us call a pair of integer numbers $ m $ -perfect, if at least one number in the pair is greater than or equal to $ m $ . Thus, the pairs (3, 3) and (0, 2) are 2-perfect while the pair (-1, 1) is not.
Two integers $ x $ , $ y $ are written on the blackboard. It is allowed to erase one of them and replace it with the sum of the numbers, $ (x+y) $ .
What is the minimum number of such operations one has to perform in order to make the given pair of integers $ m $ -perfect?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Single line of the input contains three integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ m $ ( $ -10^{18}<=x $ , $ y $ , $ m<=10^{18} $ ).
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of operations or "-1" (without quotes), if it is impossible to transform the given pair to the $ m $ -perfect one.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the following sequence of operations is suitable: (1, 2) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (3, 2) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (5, 2).
In the second sample: (-1, 4) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (3, 4) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (7, 4) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (11, 4) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF317A/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) (15, 4).
Finally, in the third sample $ x $ , $ y $ cannot be made positive, hence there is no proper sequence of operations.</div>
