<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
根据Berland的法律，不准向年龄未满18岁的人出售酒。Vasya的工作是监督此法律的执行。今晚他走进了一个酒吧，看到n个人坐在那儿。对于每一个人，Vasya都恰好知道了要么这个人的年龄要么这个人正在喝的饮料。Vasya可以检查任何一个人，换句话说，就是了解这个人的年龄和他正在喝的饮料。Vasya至少需要检查多少人才能保证没有18岁以下的顾客饮酒？
所有Berland的酒如下:
ABSINTH, BEER, BRANDY, CHAMPAGNE, GIN, RUM, SAKE, TEQUILA, VODKA, WHISKEY, WINE
输入格式：
第一行仅包含一个整数n（$1\leq n\leq100$），表示酒吧里的顾客数。接下来n行，每行描述了一个顾客。一行要么包含它的年龄（一个从0到1000的整数）,要么是他的饮料（一串长度为1到100的大写的拉丁字母）。保证输入不含空格和其他多余的分隔符
只有上面列表中列出的饮料被认为是酒
输出格式：
输出一个数字，表示Vasya为保证执法要检查的人数
说明
在样例中，应该检查第二个和第五个顾客
