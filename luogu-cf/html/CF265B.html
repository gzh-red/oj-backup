<h1>Roadside Trees (Simplified Edition)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Squirrel Liss loves nuts. There are $ n $ trees (numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ from west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the tree $ i $ is $ h_{i} $ . Liss wants to eat all nuts.
Now Liss is on the root of the tree with the number $ 1 $ . In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:
- Walk up or down one unit on a tree.
- Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.
- Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height $ h $ of the tree $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ), she jumps to height $ h $ of the tree $ i+1 $ . This action can't be performed if $ h&gt;h_{i+1} $ .
Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of trees.
Next $ n $ lines contains the height of trees: $ i $ -th line contains an integer $ h_{i} $ ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=10^{4} $ ) — the height of the tree with the number $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds.</div>
