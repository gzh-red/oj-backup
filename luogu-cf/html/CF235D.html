<div>题目描述
求基环树随机点分治总遍历次数期望
基环树随机点分治步骤：
①遍历当前分治区域所有点一次
②在当前分治区域随机选择一个点$x$
③将$x$删掉，产生的所有连通块递归处理。
输入数据
第一行一个正整数$n(1 \leq n \leq 3000)$表示树的大小，接下来$n$行每行两个非负整数$a_i , b_i(0 \leq a_i,b_i < n)$表示一条边
输出数据
一行一个浮点数表示期望，误差不超过$10^{-6}$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In computer science, there is a method called "Divide And Conquer By Node" to solve some hard problems about paths on a tree. Let's desribe how this method works by function:
$ solve(t) $ ( $ t $ is a tree):
1. Chose a node $ x $ (it's common to chose weight-center) in tree $ t $ . Let's call this step "Line A".
2. Deal with all paths that pass $ x $ .
3. Then delete $ x $ from tree $ t $ .
4. After that $ t $ becomes some subtrees.
5. Apply $ solve $ on each subtree.
This ends when $ t $ has only one node because after deleting it, there's nothing.
Now, WJMZBMR has mistakenly believed that it's ok to chose any node in "Line A". So he'll chose a node at random. To make the situation worse, he thinks a "tree" should have the same number of edges and nodes! So this procedure becomes like that.
Let's define the variable $ totalCost $ . Initially the value of $ totalCost $ equal to $ 0 $ . So, $ solve(t) $ (now $ t $ is a graph):
1. $ totalCost=totalCost+(size of t) $ . The operation "=" means assignment. $ (Size of t) $ means the number of nodes in $ t $ .
2. Choose a node $ x $ in graph $ t $ at random (uniformly among all nodes of $ t $ ).
3. Then delete $ x $ from graph $ t $ .
4. After that $ t $ becomes some connected components.
5. Apply $ solve $ on each component.
He'll apply $ solve $ on a connected graph with $ n $ nodes and $ n $ edges. He thinks it will work quickly, but it's very slow. So he wants to know the expectation of $ totalCost $ of this procedure. Can you help him?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=3000 $ ) — the number of nodes and edges in the graph. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ $ (0<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n-1) $ indicating an edge between nodes $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ .
Consider that the graph nodes are numbered from $ 0 $ to $ (n-1) $ . It's guaranteed that there are no self-loops, no multiple edges in that graph. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single real number — the expectation of $ totalCost $ . Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
