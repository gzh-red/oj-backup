<h1>Bear and Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个字符串，找出所有的子串$\ s_{i}s_{i+1}...s_{j}$，该子串包含 $\ bear$这个单词,输出满足条件的子串个数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The bear has a string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ (record $ |s| $ is the string's length), consisting of lowercase English letters. The bear wants to count the number of such pairs of indices $ i,j $ $ (1<=i<=j<=|s|) $ , that string $ x(i,j)=s_{i}s_{i+1}...\ s_{j} $ contains at least one string "bear" as a substring.
String $ x(i,j) $ contains string "bear", if there is such index $ k $ $ (i<=k<=j-3) $ , that $ s_{k}=b $ , $ s_{k+1}=e $ , $ s_{k+2}=a $ , $ s_{k+3}=r $ .
Help the bear cope with the given problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
