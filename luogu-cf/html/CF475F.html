<h1>Meta-universe</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider infinite grid of unit cells. Some of those cells are planets.
Meta-universe $ M={p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k}} $ is a set of planets. Suppose there is an infinite row or column with following two properties: 1) it doesn't contain any planet $ p_{i} $ of meta-universe $ M $ on it; 2) there are planets of $ M $ located on both sides from this row or column. In this case we can turn the meta-universe $ M $ into two non-empty meta-universes $ M_{1} $ and $ M_{2} $ containing planets that are located on respective sides of this row or column.
A meta-universe which can't be split using operation above is called a universe. We perform such operations until all meta-universes turn to universes.
Given positions of the planets in the original meta-universe, find the number of universes that are result of described process. It can be proved that each universe is uniquely identified not depending from order of splitting.</div>
