<h1>A Lot of Games</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
Andrew,Fedor和Alex是三个善于创造的人。现在，他们发明了一种字符串双人游戏。
给出n个非空字符串。在游戏中，两位玩家一起建造一个单词。开始时，单词是一个空字符串。两位玩家轮流操作。一位玩家在他的回合中，必须在单词的后面添加一个字母，使得添加后的单词是n个字符串中至少一个的前缀。当一位玩家不能操作时，他就输掉了游戏。
Andrew和Alex决定玩k次。上一局的负者是下一局的先手。他们决定，在最后一局中获胜的人获得整场游戏的胜利。Andrew和Alex已经开始玩了，Fedor想知道，如果他们两个足够聪明，谁会胜利。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.
Given a group of $ n $ non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.
Andrew and Alex decided to play this game $ k $ times. The player who is the loser of the $ i $ -th game makes the first move in the $ (i+1) $ -th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last ( $ k $ -th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ; $ 1<=k<=10^{9} $ ).
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ . Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).</div>
