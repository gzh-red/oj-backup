<h1>Make a Square</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a positive integer $ n $ , written without leading zeroes (for example, the number 04 is incorrect).
In one operation you can delete any digit of the given integer so that the result remains a positive integer without leading zeros.
Determine the minimum number of operations that you need to consistently apply to the given integer $ n $ to make from it the square of some positive integer or report that it is impossible.
An integer $ x $ is the square of some positive integer if and only if $ x=y^2 $ for some positive integer $ y $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{9} $ ). The number is given without leading zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $ n $ , print -1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>8314
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>625
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>333
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>-1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example we should delete from $ 8314 $ the digits $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ . After that $ 8314 $ become equals to $ 81 $ , which is the square of the integer $ 9 $ .
In the second example the given $ 625 $ is the square of the integer $ 25 $ , so you should not delete anything.
In the third example it is impossible to make the square from $ 333 $ , so the answer is -1.</div>
