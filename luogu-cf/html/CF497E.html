<h1>Subsequences Return</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div> 设sk(x)表示x在k进制下各位数的和mod k的值。给出k，现有序列sk(1),sk(2),...sk(n)。
求这个序列有多少个本质不同的子序列。
n≤1018,k≤30</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Assume that $ s_{k}(n) $ equals the sum of digits of number $ n $ in the $ k $ -based notation. For example, $ s_{2}(5)=s_{2}(101_{2})=1+0+1=2 $ , $ s_{3}(14)=s_{3}(112_{3})=1+1+2=4 $ .
The sequence of integers $ a_{0},...,a_{n-1} $ is defined as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF497E/6cf1a2e064eafad1586b721275139d1721b088bf.png). Your task is to calculate the number of distinct subsequences of sequence $ a_{0},...,a_{n-1} $ . Calculate the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
Sequence $ a_{1},...,a_{k} $ is called to be a subsequence of sequence $ b_{1},...,b_{l} $ , if there is a sequence of indices $ 1<=i_{1}&lt;...&lt;i_{k}<=l $ , such that $ a_{1}=b_{i1} $ , ..., $ a_{k}=b_{ik} $ . In particular, an empty sequence (i.e. the sequence consisting of zero elements) is a subsequence of any sequence.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the sequence $ a_{i} $ looks as follows: $ (0,1,1,0) $ . All the possible subsequences are:
$ (),(0),(0,0),(0,1),(0,1,0),(0,1,1),(0,1,1,0),(1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,1,0). $ In the second sample the sequence $ a_{i} $ looks as follows: $ (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) $ . The subsequences of this sequence are exactly all increasing sequences formed from numbers from 0 to 6. It is easy to see that there are $ 2^{7}=128 $ such sequences.</div>
