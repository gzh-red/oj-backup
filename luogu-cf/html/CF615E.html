<h1>Hexagons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF615E/7260dcf1ee40fd1194e895987c69d1d7c92f50b5.png)![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF615E/91f722e14e3f2875c1cec2e05543b6613c3b2f75.png) Ayrat is searching through the field. He started at point $ (0,0) $ and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after $ n $ moves.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{18} $ ) — the number of Ayrat's moves.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers $ x $ and $ y $ — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.</div>
