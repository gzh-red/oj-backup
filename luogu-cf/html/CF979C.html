<h1>Kuro and Walking Route</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$n$ 个结点，编号从 $1$ 到 $n$ ， $n-1$ 条双向边的连通图，问图中有多少点对 $(u,v)$ 使得从 $u$ 到 $v$ 的最短路上，**不存在**先到达 $x$ ，再到达 $y$ 的情况。点对 $(u,v)$ 与点对 $(v,u)$ 被认为是不同的。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of $ n $ towns, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and $ n - 1 $ bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns $ a $ and $ b $ . Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns $ (u, v) $ ( $ u \neq v $ ) and walk from $ u $ using the shortest path to $ v $ (note that $ (u, v) $ is considered to be different from $ (v, u) $ ).
Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index $ x $ ) and Beetopia (denoted with the index $ y $ ). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns $ (u, v) $ if on the path from $ u $ to $ v $ , he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.
Kuro wants to know how many pair of city $ (u, v) $ he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \leq x, y \leq n $ , $ x \ne y $ ) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.
$ n - 1 $ lines follow, each line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \leq a, b \leq n $ , $ a \ne b $ ), describes a road connecting two towns $ a $ and $ b $ .
It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns $ (u, v) $ that Kuro can use as his walking route.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>On the first example, Kuro can choose these pairs:
- $ (1, 2) $ : his route would be $ 1 \rightarrow 2 $ ,
- $ (2, 3) $ : his route would be $ 2 \rightarrow 3 $ ,
- $ (3, 2) $ : his route would be $ 3 \rightarrow 2 $ ,
- $ (2, 1) $ : his route would be $ 2 \rightarrow 1 $ ,
- $ (3, 1) $ : his route would be $ 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 $ .
Kuro can't choose pair $ (1, 3) $ since his walking route would be $ 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 $ , in which Kuro visits town $ 1 $ (Flowrisa) and then visits town $ 3 $ (Beetopia), which is not allowed (note that pair $ (3, 1) $ is still allowed because although Kuro visited Flowrisa and Beetopia, he did not visit them in that order).
On the second example, Kuro can choose the following pairs:
- $ (1, 2) $ : his route would be $ 1 \rightarrow 2 $ ,
- $ (2, 1) $ : his route would be $ 2 \rightarrow 1 $ ,
- $ (3, 2) $ : his route would be $ 3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 $ ,
- $ (3, 1) $ : his route would be $ 3 \rightarrow 1 $ .</div>
