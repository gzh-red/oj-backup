<h1>Orchestra</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>本翻译由[$Morning\_Glory$](https://www.luogu.org/space/show?uid=89048)翻译，由于暂被禁言，我来代发
**题目大意** 有一个$r * c$的矩阵上有$n$个点，问有多少个子矩阵里包含至少$k$个点
**输入格式** 第一行四个数$r,c,n,k$，接下来$n$行，每行两个数$x_i,y_i$，表示第$i$个点的坐标
**输出格式** 一行一个数表示合法子矩阵个数
**数据范围** $1\leq r,c,n\leq 3000 , 1\leq k\leq \min(n,10)$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Paul is at the orchestra. The string section is arranged in an $ r×c $ rectangular grid and is filled with violinists with the exception of $ n $ violists. Paul really likes violas, so he would like to take a picture including at least $ k $ of them. Paul can take a picture of any axis-parallel rectangle in the orchestra. Count the number of possible pictures that Paul can take.
Two pictures are considered to be different if the coordinates of corresponding rectangles are different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains four space-separated integers $ r $ , $ c $ , $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=r,c,n<=3000 $ , $ 1<=k<=min(n,10) $ ) — the number of rows and columns of the string section, the total number of violas, and the minimum number of violas Paul would like in his photograph, respectively.
The next $ n $ lines each contain two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=r $ , $ 1<=y_{i}<=c $ ): the position of the $ i $ -th viola. It is guaranteed that no location appears more than once in the input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of photographs Paul can take which include at least $ k $ violas.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>We will use '\*' to denote violinists and '\#' to denote violists.
In the first sample, the orchestra looks as follows:
`<br></br>*#<br></br>**<br></br>` Paul can take a photograph of just the viola, the $ 1×2 $ column containing the viola, the $ 2×1 $ row containing the viola, or the entire string section, for $ 4 $ pictures total.In the second sample, the orchestra looks as follows:
`<br></br>#*<br></br>*#<br></br>#*<br></br>` Paul must take a photograph of the entire section.In the third sample, the orchestra looks the same as in the second sample.</div>
