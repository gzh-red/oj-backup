<h1>Guard Duty (hard)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定平面上n个红点和n个黑点，保证互不相同，无三点共线，求一个红点到黑点的完美匹配，使得匹配之间的连线互不相交。数据保证有解。
$n\leq 10^4$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Now that Heidi knows that she can assign Rebel spaceships to bases (recall the easy subtask), she is asking you: how exactly to do this? Now, given positions of $ N $ spaceships and $ N $ bases on a plane, your task is to connect spaceships and bases with line segments so that:
- The segments do not intersect.
- Such a connection forms a perfect matching.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ ). For $ 1<=i<=N $ , the $ i+1 $ -th line contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ |x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10000 $ ) denoting the coordinates of the $ i $ -th spaceship. The following $ N $ lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are on the same line.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should have $ N $ lines. The $ i $ -th line should contain an integer $ p_{i} $ , the index of the base to which the $ i $ -th spaceship is connected. The sequence $ p_{1},...,p_{N} $ should form a permutation of $ 1,...,N $ .
It is guaranteed that a solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any one of them.</div>
