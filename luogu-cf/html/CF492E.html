> 滑稽树上滑稽果
> 滑稽树下你和我
> 滑稽树前做游戏
> 滑稽多又多
一天，Vanya 来到了一片滑稽树林中，准备采摘滑稽果。滑稽树林可看作一个 $n \times n$ 的正方形，其中$m$个点上有滑稽果，某些点没有。（注意一个点上可能有多个滑稽果）
Vanya会沿向量$(dx,dy)$方向移动。也就是说，如果Vanya在$(x,y)$处，她将移动到 $((x+dx)modn,(y+dy)modn)$处。每到一个点，她会拿走该点所有滑稽果。($dx,dy$为定值(输入中给出)，且$gcd(n,dx)=gcd(n,dy)=1$)
由于滑稽树林太巨了，当Vanya走到一个她走到过的点时，她就会停止走动。
现在Vanya想知道她怎么走才能拿到最多的滑稽果。
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
第一行四个数: $n,m,dx,dy$
接下来$m$行，每行两个数$x,y$表在$(x,y)$处有一个滑稽果。
## 输出格式：
两个数$x,y$，表示Vanya从$(x,y)$处出发可拿到最多滑稽果。
如果有多个答案，输出任意一个</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya decided to walk in the field of size $ n×n $ cells. The field contains $ m $ apple trees, the $ i $ -th apple tree is at the cell with coordinates $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ . Vanya moves towards vector $ (dx,dy) $ . That means that if Vanya is now at the cell $ (x,y) $ , then in a second he will be at cell ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF492E/ca24b7691e299109f63128c263a4ac04bc24322f.png). The following condition is satisfied for the vector: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF492E/c2bf6dc0b914cca7589d37daae8596f4ad85c220.png), where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF492E/8ea8f21b5c14716258752d62a549551fbdbf04b7.png) is the largest integer that divides both $ a $ and $ b $ . Vanya ends his path when he reaches the square he has already visited.
Vanya wonders, from what square of the field he should start his path to see as many apple trees as possible.</div>
