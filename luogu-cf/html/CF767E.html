<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有无限张100元的纸币和m张1元的纸币。在接下来的n天，你第i天需要花费ci元，但收银员第i天每找零1元，就会增加wi点愤怒值，你想要最小化收银员的愤怒值。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Student Arseny likes to plan his life for $ n $ days ahead. He visits a canteen every day and he has already decided what he will order in each of the following $ n $ days. Prices in the canteen do not change and that means Arseny will spend $ c_{i} $ rubles during the $ i $ -th day.
There are $ 1 $ -ruble coins and $ 100 $ -ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny has $ m $ coins and a sufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an infinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses his credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash in the canteen because it does not accept cards.
Cashier always asks the student to pay change-free. However, it's not always possible, but Arseny tries to minimize the dissatisfaction of the cashier. Cashier's dissatisfaction for each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and coins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arseny $ x $ notes and coins on the $ i $ -th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equals $ x·w_{i} $ . Cashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible, he always has enough of them to be able to do this.

Angry cashier"Arseny wants to pay in such a way that the total dissatisfaction of the cashier for $ n $ days would be as small as possible. Help him to find out how he needs to pay in each of the $ n $ days!
Note that Arseny always has enough money to pay, because he has an infinite amount of notes. Arseny can use notes and coins he received in change during any of the following days.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{9} $ ) — the amount of days Arseny planned his actions for and the amount of coins he currently has.
The second line contains a sequence of integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — the amounts of money in rubles which Arseny is going to spend for each of the following days.
The third line contains a sequence of integers $ w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n} $ ( $ 1<=w_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — the cashier's dissatisfaction coefficients for each of the following days.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print one integer — minimum possible total dissatisfaction of the cashier.
Then print $ n $ lines, the $ i $ -th of then should contain two numbers — the amount of notes and the amount of coins which Arseny should use to pay in the canteen on the $ i $ -th day.
Of course, the total amount of money Arseny gives to the casher in any of the days should be no less than the amount of money he has planned to spend. It also shouldn't exceed $ 10^{6} $ rubles: Arseny never carries large sums of money with him.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
