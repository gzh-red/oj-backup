<h1>Similar Words</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let us call a non-empty sequence of lowercase English letters a word. Prefix of a word $ x $ is a word $ y $ that can be obtained from $ x $ by removing zero or more last letters of $ x $ .
Let us call two words similar, if one of them can be obtained from the other by removing its first letter.
You are given a set $ S $ of words. Find the maximal possible size of set of non-empty words $ X $ such that they satisfy the following:
- each word of $ X $ is prefix of some word from $ S $ ;
- $ X $ has no similar words.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input data contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input data contains an integer $ t $ — the number of test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.
The first line of each description contains an integer $ n $ — the number of words in the set $ S $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ). Each of the following $ n $ lines contains one non-empty word — elements of $ S $ . All words in $ S $ are different.
It is guaranteed that the total length of all words in one input data doesn't exceed $ 10^{6} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print one line that contains one integer $ m $ — the maximal number of words that $ X $ can contain.</div>
