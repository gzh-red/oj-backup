<h1>Longest k-Good Segment</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个包含$n$个整数的序列$a$，$0\le a_i \le 10^6$ ，询问不重复数字个数$\le k$的最长区间的左右端点。如果有多解输出任意一组。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The array $ a $ with $ n $ integers is given. Let's call the sequence of one or more consecutive elements in $ a $ segment. Also let's call the segment k-good if it contains no more than $ k $ different values.
Find any longest k-good segment.
As the input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n,k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=5·10^{5} $ ) — the number of elements in $ a $ and the parameter $ k $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) — the elements of the array $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers $ l,r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) — the index of the left and the index of the right ends of some k-good longest segment. If there are several longest segments you can print any of them. The elements in $ a $ are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right.</div>
