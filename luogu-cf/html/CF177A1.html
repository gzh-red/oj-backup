<h1>Good Matrix Elements</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于一个n*n的矩阵，求出处于矩阵对角线，中间行和中间列的所有元素之和(保证n是个奇数)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Smart Beaver from ABBYY got hooked on square matrices. Now he is busy studying an $ n×n $ size matrix, where $ n $ is odd. The Smart Beaver considers the following matrix elements good:
- Elements of the main diagonal.
- Elements of the secondary diagonal.
- Elements of the "middle" row — the row which has exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF177A1/020372175e2da20d0daf928d1765e1cdfd92e9c2.png) rows above it and the same number of rows below it.
- Elements of the "middle" column — the column that has exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF177A1/020372175e2da20d0daf928d1765e1cdfd92e9c2.png) columns to the left of it and the same number of columns to the right of it.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input data contains a single odd integer $ n $ . Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ n $ integers $ a_{ij} $ $ (0<=a_{ij}<=100) $ separated by single spaces — the elements of the given matrix.
The input limitations for getting 30 points are:
- $ 1<=n<=5 $
The input limitations for getting 100 points are:
- $ 1<=n<=101 $</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the sum of good matrix elements.</div>
