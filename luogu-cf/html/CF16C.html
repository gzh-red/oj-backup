<h1>Monitor</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一矩形长a和宽b，给出长宽比x:y，缩短矩形的长和宽,使它的长和宽之比等于x:y,试求最终的长宽
输入:a,b,x,y
输出:输出最终的长宽
1<=a,b,x,y<=2*10^9
Translated by 稀神探女</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Reca company makes monitors, the most popular of their models is AB999 with the screen size $ a×b $ centimeters. Because of some production peculiarities a screen parameters are integer numbers. Recently the screen sides ratio $ x:y $ became popular with users. That's why the company wants to reduce monitor AB999 size so that its screen sides ratio becomes $ x:y $ , at the same time they want its total area to be maximal of all possible variants. Your task is to find the screen parameters of the reduced size model, or find out that such a reduction can't be performed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains 4 integers — $ a $ , $ b $ , $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=a,b,x,y<=2·10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the answer exists, output 2 positive integers — screen parameters of the reduced size model. Output 0 0 otherwise.</div>
