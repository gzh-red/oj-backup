<h1>Crazy Computer</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个$N(N<=100000)$个字母敲击的时间$a[i](a[i]<=10^9)$，如果在$M$时间内没有敲击那么屏幕就清零，否则屏幕上就多一个字母，问最后屏幕剩下几个字母。
打下下一个字母的时候，如果和之前字母打下的时间不超过$k$的话，则保留前面的继续打，如果超过了，则前面的字母全部消失，只留下这一个字母。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>ZS the Coder is coding on a crazy computer. If you don't type in a word for a $ c $ consecutive seconds, everything you typed disappear!
More formally, if you typed a word at second $ a $ and then the next word at second $ b $ , then if $ b-a<=c $ , just the new word is appended to other words on the screen. If $ b-a&gt;c $ , then everything on the screen disappears and after that the word you have typed appears on the screen.
For example, if $ c=5 $ and you typed words at seconds $ 1,3,8,14,19,20 $ then at the second $ 8 $ there will be $ 3 $ words on the screen. After that, everything disappears at the second $ 13 $ because nothing was typed. At the seconds $ 14 $ and $ 19 $ another two words are typed, and finally, at the second $ 20 $ , one more word is typed, and a total of $ 3 $ words remain on the screen.
You're given the times when ZS the Coder typed the words. Determine how many words remain on the screen after he finished typing everything.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ c $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000,1<=c<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of words ZS the Coder typed and the crazy computer delay respectively.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 1<=t_{1}&lt;t_{2}&lt;...&lt;t_{n}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ t_{i} $ denotes the second when ZS the Coder typed the $ i $ -th word.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single positive integer, the number of words that remain on the screen after all $ n $ words was typed, in other words, at the second $ t_{n} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6 5
1 3 8 14 19 20

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first sample is already explained in the problem statement.
For the second sample, after typing the first word at the second $ 1 $ , it disappears because the next word is typed at the second $ 3 $ and $ 3-1&gt;1 $ . Similarly, only $ 1 $ word will remain at the second $ 9 $ . Then, a word is typed at the second $ 10 $ , so there will be two words on the screen, as the old word won't disappear because $ 10-9<=1 $ .</div>
