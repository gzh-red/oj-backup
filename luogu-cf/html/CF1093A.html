<h1>Dice Rolling</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 原题意简述：
Mishka 有一个六面的骰子，每面分别为 $2$ ~ $7$，而且 Mishka 是欧皇，可以控制自己每次掷到的数字。Mishka 现在想掷若干次骰子，使得掷到的点数总和为 $x$，请求出任意一种掷骰子的方案，并输出掷骰子的次数。由于 Mishka 很好奇不同数字的方案，所以有 $t$ 组询问。
### 一句话题意：
$x$ 是给定的，求任意一个 $k$ 使得存在某一组 $a_{1..k}$ 满足 $\sum_{j=1}^ka_j=x(a_j\in\{2,3,4,5,6,7\})$，共有 $t$ 组询问。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mishka got a six-faced dice. It has integer numbers from $ 2 $ to $ 7 $ written on its faces (all numbers on faces are different, so this is an almost usual dice).
Mishka wants to get exactly $ x $ points by rolling his dice. The number of points is just a sum of numbers written at the topmost face of the dice for all the rolls Mishka makes.
Mishka doesn't really care about the number of rolls, so he just wants to know any number of rolls he can make to be able to get exactly $ x $ points for them. Mishka is very lucky, so if the probability to get $ x $ points with chosen number of rolls is non-zero, he will be able to roll the dice in such a way. Your task is to print this number. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.
Mishka is also very curious about different number of points to score so you have to answer $ t $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) — the number of queries.
Each of the next $ t $ lines contains one integer each. The $ i $ -th line contains one integer $ x_i $ ( $ 2 \le x_i \le 100 $ ) — the number of points Mishka wants to get.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ t $ lines. In the $ i $ -th line print the answer to the $ i $ -th query (i.e. any number of rolls Mishka can make to be able to get exactly $ x_i $ points for them). It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query Mishka can roll a dice once and get $ 2 $ points.
In the second query Mishka can roll a dice $ 3 $ times and get points $ 5 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 3 $ (for example).
In the third query Mishka can roll a dice $ 8 $ times and get $ 5 $ points $ 7 $ times and $ 2 $ points with the remaining roll.
In the fourth query Mishka can roll a dice $ 27 $ times and get $ 2 $ points $ 11 $ times, $ 3 $ points $ 6 $ times and $ 6 $ points $ 10 $ times.</div>
