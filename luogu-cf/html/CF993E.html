<h1>Nikita and Order Statistics</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Nikita likes tasks on order statistics, for example, he can easily find the $ k $ -th number in increasing order on a segment of an array. But now Nikita wonders how many segments of an array there are such that a given number $ x $ is the $ k $ -th number in increasing order on this segment. In other words, you should find the number of segments of a given array such that there are exactly $ k $ numbers of this segment which are less than $ x $ .
Nikita wants to get answer for this question for each $ k $ from $ 0 $ to $ n $ , where $ n $ is the size of the array.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ x $ $ (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, -10^9 \le x \le 10^9) $ .
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ $ (-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9) $ — the given array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n+1 $ integers, where the $ i $ -th number is the answer for Nikita's question for $ k=i-1 $ .</div>
