<h1>Two-gram</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个字符串，找出现次数最多的长度为2的子串。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.
You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string $ s $ = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in $ s $ three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.
Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer number $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the length of string $ s $ . The second line of the input contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string $ s $ as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>7
ABACABA
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>AB
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5
ZZZAA
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>ZZ
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example "BA" is also valid answer.
In the second example the only two-gram "ZZ" can be printed because it contained in the string "ZZZAA" two times.</div>
