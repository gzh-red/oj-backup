序列123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...是无穷无尽的,现在你要输出它的第k项。
## 输入格式
一个整数k(k<=$10^{12})$。
## 输出格式
"题目描述"中的序列的第k项。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from $ 1 $ without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...
Your task is to print the $ k $ -th digit of this sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le 10^{12} $ ) — the position to process ( $ 1 $ -based index).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the $ k $ -th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.</div>
