<h1>1-2-K Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
现有n个东西，每次可以取1个，2个或k个
Alice和Bob轮流取，且Alice先取
问谁是最后一个取的
每组数据有t个询问
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
第1行一个正整数t$(1<=t<=100)$
第2到t+1行每行两个自然数n和k$(0<=n<=10^9,3<=k<=10^9)$
### 输出格式：
共t行，每行输出`Alice`或`Bob`，表示赢家</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice and Bob play a game. There is a paper strip which is divided into $ n+1 $ cells numbered from left to right starting from $ 0 $ . There is a chip placed in the $ n $ -th cell (the last one).
Players take turns, Alice is first. Each player during his or her turn has to move the chip $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ or $ k $ cells to the left (so, if the chip is currently in the cell $ i $ , the player can move it into cell $ i-1 $ , $ i-2 $ or $ i-k $ ). The chip should not leave the borders of the paper strip: it is impossible, for example, to move it $ k $ cells to the left if the current cell has number $ i<k $ . The player who can't make a move loses the game.

Who wins if both participants play optimally?

Alice and Bob would like to play several games, so you should determine the winner in each game.</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first line contains the single integer $ T $ ( $ 1<=T<=100 $ ) — the number of games. Next $ T $ lines contain one game per line. All games are independent.

Each of the next $ T $ lines contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{9} $ , $ 3<=k<=10^{9} $ ) — the length of the strip and the constant denoting the third move, respectively.</div>
    <h3>输出格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>For each game, print Alice if Alice wins this game and Bob otherwise.</div>
