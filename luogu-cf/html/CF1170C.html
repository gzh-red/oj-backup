<h1>Minus and Minus Give Plus</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**本题仅允许使用`kotlin`提交**
多组询问
每次给定两个只包含`-`,`+`的字符串$s,t$
你可以将两个相邻的`-`合并为一个`+`
对于每组询问你需要回答是否可以在对$s$进行若干次操作后得到$t$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everyone knows that two consecutive (adjacent) "minus" signs can be replaced with a single "plus" sign.
You are given the string $ s $ , consisting of "plus" and "minus" signs only. Zero or more operations can be performed with it. In each operation you can choose any two adjacent "minus" signs, and replace them with a single "plus" sign. Thus, in one operation, the length of the string is reduced by exactly $ 1 $ .
You are given two strings $ s $ and $ t $ . Determine if you can use $ 0 $ or more operations to get the string $ t $ from the string $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le 10^5 $ ), denoting the number of test cases in the input. The following lines contain descriptions of the test sets, each set consists of two lines. First comes the line containing $ s $ (the length of the line $ s $ does not exceed $ 2\cdot10^5 $ ), then comes the line containing $ t $ (the length of the line $ t $ does not exceed $ 2\cdot10^5 $ ). The lines $ s $ and $ t $ are non-empty, and they contain only "plus" and "minus" signs.
The sum of the lengths of lines $ s $ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $ 2\cdot10^5 $ . Similarly, the sum of the lengths of lines $ t $ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $ 2\cdot10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ k $ lines: the $ i $ -th line must contain YES if the answer to the $ i $ -th test case is positive, otherwise NO. Print YES and NO using uppercase letters only.</div>
