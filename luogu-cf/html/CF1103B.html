<h1>Game with modulo</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目：未知一个数$a$，让你每次猜两个数$x$和$y$，若$x%a>=y%a$返回"x"，否则返回"y"。让你猜测次数少于60次的时候猜出数$a$。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is an interactive problem.
Vasya and Petya are going to play the following game: Petya has some positive integer number $ a $ . After that Vasya should guess this number using the following questions. He can say a pair of non-negative integer numbers $ (x, y) $ . Petya will answer him:
- "x", if $ (x \bmod a) \geq (y \bmod a) $ .
- "y", if $ (x \bmod a) < (y \bmod a) $ .
We define $ (x \bmod a) $ as a remainder of division $ x $ by $ a $ .
Vasya should guess the number $ a $ using no more, than 60 questions.
It's guaranteed that Petya has a number, that satisfies the inequality $ 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 $ .
Help Vasya playing this game and write a program, that will guess the number $ a $ .</div>

<div>Your program should play several games.
Before the start of any game your program should read the string:
- "start" (without quotes) — the start of the new game.
- "mistake" (without quotes) — in the previous game, you found the wrong answer. Your program should terminate after reading this string and it will get verdict "Wrong answer".
- "end" (without quotes) — all games finished. Your program should terminate after reading this string.
After reading the string "start" (without quotes) the new game starts.
At the beginning, your program should ask several questions about pairs of non-negative integer numbers $ (x, y) $ . You can only ask the numbers, that satisfy the inequalities $ 0 \leq x, y \leq 2 \cdot 10^9 $ . To ask a question print "? x y" (without quotes). As the answer, you should read one symbol:
- "x" (without quotes), if $ (x \bmod a) \geq (y \bmod a) $ .
- "y" (without quotes), if $ (x \bmod a) < (y \bmod a) $ .
- "e" (without quotes) — you asked more than $ 60 $ questions. Your program should terminate after reading this string and it will get verdict "Wrong answer".
After your program asked several questions your program should print the answer in form "! a" (without quotes). You should print the number $ a $ satisfying the inequalities $ 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 $ . It's guaranteed that Petya's number $ a $ satisfied this condition. After that, the current game will finish.
We recall that your program can't ask more than $ 60 $ questions during one game.
If your program doesn't terminate after reading "mistake" (without quotes), "end" (without quotes) or "e" (without quotes), it can get any verdict, because it will continue reading from closed input. Also, if your program prints answer or question in the incorrect format it can get any verdict, too. Be careful.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing questions and answers.
To flush the output, you can use:
- fflush(stdout) in C++.
- System.out.flush() in Java.
- stdout.flush() in Python.
- flush(output) in Pascal.
- See the documentation for other languages.
It's guaranteed that you should play at least $ 1 $ and no more than $ 100 $ games.
Hacks:
In hacks, you can use only one game. To hack a solution with Petya's number $ a $ ( $ 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 $ ) in the first line you should write a single number $ 1 $ and in the second line you should write a single number $ a $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test, you should play $ 3 $ games with Petya's numbers $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ .
In the first game, Petya will answer "x" (without quotes) to any question, because $ (x \bmod 1) = 0 $ for any integer $ x $ .
In the second game, if you will ask pair $ (0, 0) $ , the answer will be "x" (without quotes), because $ (0 \bmod 2) \geq (0 \bmod 2) $ . But if you will ask pair $ (2, 5) $ , the answer will be "y" (without quotes), because $ (2 \bmod 2) < (5 \bmod 2) $ , because $ (2 \bmod 2) = 0 $ and $ (5 \bmod 2) = 1 $ .</div>
