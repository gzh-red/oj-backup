<h1>Pair of Toys</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定n个玩具要你选出两个玩具求出k的价值。
第i个玩具的价值为i。
样例1：从8个玩具里选出两个使价值为5.
有以下方案：（1 4）（2 3）。
若是没有选择方案，输出0
补充：玩具A与玩具B 和 玩具B和玩具A 是同一种选择</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tanechka is shopping in the toy shop. There are exactly $ n $ toys in the shop for sale, the cost of the $ i $ -th toy is $ i $ burles. She wants to choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is $ k $ burles. How many ways to do that does she have?
Each toy appears in the shop exactly once. Pairs $ (a, b) $ and $ (b, a) $ are considered equal. Pairs $ (a, b) $ , where $ a=b $ , are not allowed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n, k \le 10^{14} $ ) — the number of toys and the expected total cost of the pair of toys.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of ways to choose the pair of toys satisfying the condition above. Print 0, if Tanechka can choose no pair of toys in such a way that their total cost is $ k $ burles.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Tanechka can choose the pair of toys ( $ 1, 4 $ ) or the pair of toys ( $ 2, 3 $ ).
In the second example Tanechka can choose only the pair of toys ( $ 7, 8 $ ).
In the third example choosing any pair of toys will lead to the total cost less than $ 20 $ . So the answer is 0.
In the fourth example she can choose the following pairs: $ (1, 1000000000000) $ , $ (2, 999999999999) $ , $ (3, 999999999998) $ , ..., $ (500000000000, 500000000001) $ . The number of such pairs is exactly $ 500000000000 $ .</div>
