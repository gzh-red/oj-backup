<h1>Fafa and the Gates</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two neighboring kingdoms decided to build a wall between them with some gates to enable the citizens to go from one kingdom to another. Each time a citizen passes through a gate, he has to pay one silver coin.
The world can be represented by the first quadrant of a plane and the wall is built along the identity line (i.e. the line with the equation $ x=y $ ). Any point below the wall belongs to the first kingdom while any point above the wall belongs to the second kingdom. There is a gate at any integer point on the line (i.e. at points $ (0,0) $ , $ (1,1) $ , $ (2,2) $ , ...). The wall and the gates do not belong to any of the kingdoms.
Fafa is at the gate at position $ (0,0) $ and he wants to walk around in the two kingdoms. He knows the sequence $ S $ of moves he will do. This sequence is a string where each character represents a move. The two possible moves Fafa will do are 'U' (move one step up, from $ (x,y) $ to $ (x,y+1) $ ) and 'R' (move one step right, from $ (x,y) $ to $ (x+1,y) $ ).
Fafa wants to know the number of silver coins he needs to pay to walk around the two kingdoms following the sequence $ S $ . Note that if Fafa visits a gate without moving from one kingdom to another, he pays no silver coins. Also assume that he doesn't pay at the gate at point $ (0,0) $ , i. e. he is initially on the side he needs.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of moves in the walking sequence.
The second line contains a string $ S $ of length $ n $ consisting of the characters 'U' and 'R' describing the required moves. Fafa will follow the sequence $ S $ in order from left to right.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line, print one integer representing the number of silver coins Fafa needs to pay at the gates to follow the sequence $ S $ .</div>
