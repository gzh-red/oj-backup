<h1>Planning The Expedition</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$Natasha$ 等 $n$个人正计划远征火星，需要为每位参与者提供食物。仓库里有$m$包食物。第$i$包食品的类型是$a_i$。每个参与者每天必须吃一包食物。由于某种原因，每个参与者必须在整个探险过程中吃同种类型的食物，不同的参与者可以吃不同（或相同）类型的食物。当有任意一个参与者没有食物吃的时候，探险结束。
根据上述要求，探险可以持续的最长天数是多少？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Natasha is planning an expedition to Mars for $ n $ people. One of the important tasks is to provide food for each participant.
The warehouse has $ m $ daily food packages. Each package has some food type $ a_i $ .
Each participant must eat exactly one food package each day. Due to extreme loads, each participant must eat the same food type throughout the expedition. Different participants may eat different (or the same) types of food.
Formally, for each participant $ j $ Natasha should select his food type $ b_j $ and each day $ j $ -th participant will eat one food package of type $ b_j $ . The values $ b_j $ for different participants may be different.
What is the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last, following the requirements above?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ , $ 1 \le m \le 100 $ ) — the number of the expedition participants and the number of the daily food packages available.
The second line contains sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the type of $ i $ -th food package.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single integer — the number of days the expedition can last. If it is not possible to plan the expedition for even one day, print 0.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Natasha can assign type $ 1 $ food to the first participant, the same type $ 1 $ to the second, type $ 5 $ to the third and type $ 2 $ to the fourth. In this case, the expedition can last for $ 2 $ days, since each participant can get two food packages of his food type (there will be used $ 4 $ packages of type $ 1 $ , two packages of type $ 2 $ and two packages of type $ 5 $ ).
In the second example, there are $ 100 $ participants and only $ 1 $ food package. In this case, the expedition can't last even $ 1 $ day.</div>
