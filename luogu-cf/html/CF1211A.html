<h1>Three Problems</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数列$r$，找出三个数$r_a,r_b,r_c$,使得$r_a<r_b<r_c$，如果多组解输出任意一组(在数列中的下标)，如果无解输出三个$-1$ translate by @[vercont](https://www.luogu.org/space/show?uid=45475)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp is choosing three problems for creating a programming test. Totally he has $ n $ problems in his list. The complexity of the $ i $ -th problem equals $ r_i $ . All problems are numerated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
Help Polycarp to choose such three problems $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ , so that the complexity of the first problem strictly less than the complexity of second problem and the complexity of the second problem is strictly less than the complexity of the third problem. So, for chosen problems $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ it should be true that $ r_a < r_b < r_c $ .
If Polycarp can choose three problems in different ways, you can print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \le n \le 3000 $ ) — the number of problems in Polycarp's list.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n $ ( $ 1 \le r_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ r_i $ is the complexity of the $ i $ -th problem.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Polycarp has no ways to choose three problems, you should print three numbers -1. Ih there is a way to choose them, you should print three different integers $ a, b, c $ ( $ 1 \le a, b, c \le n $ ), where $ a $ is the number of the first chosen problem, $ b $ is the number of the second chosen problem and $ c $ is the number of the third chosen problem.</div>
