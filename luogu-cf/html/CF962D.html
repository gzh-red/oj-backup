<h1>Merge Equals</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定正整数序列a[1...N]，每次你需要找到序列中出现次数>=2的最小值x，找到x的2个最小下标{i,j}，删除a[i]，将a[j]改为2x。
反复进行如此操作，求序列最终的形态。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array of positive integers. While there are at least two equal elements, we will perform the following operation. We choose the smallest value $ x $ that occurs in the array $ 2 $ or more times. Take the first two occurrences of $ x $ in this array (the two leftmost occurrences). Remove the left of these two occurrences, and the right one is replaced by the sum of this two values (that is, $ 2 \cdot x $ ).
Determine how the array will look after described operations are performed.
For example, consider the given array looks like $ [3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1] $ . It will be changed in the following way: $ [3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]~\rightarrow~[3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1]~\rightarrow~[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]~\rightarrow~[3, 8, 2, 1] $ .
If the given array is look like $ [1, 1, 3, 1, 1] $ it will be changed in the following way: $ [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]~\rightarrow~[2, 3, 1, 1]~\rightarrow~[2, 3, 2]~\rightarrow~[3, 4] $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 150\,000 $ ) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains a sequence from $ n $ elements $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^{9} $ ) — the elements of the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print an integer $ k $ — the number of elements in the array after all the performed operations. In the second line print $ k $ integers — the elements of the array after all the performed operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first two examples were considered in the statement.
In the third example all integers in the given array are distinct, so it will not change.</div>
