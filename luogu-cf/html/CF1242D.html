<h1>Number Discovery</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Ujan要构造无限序列。
> 刚开始有个空序列s，他每次找到k个不属于s最小正整数，把它们和它们的加和插入到s中。
当n在序列中出现时，Ujan就结束操作，请你求出n在s中的位置。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ujan needs some rest from cleaning, so he started playing with infinite sequences. He has two integers $ n $ and $ k $ . He creates an infinite sequence $ s $ by repeating the following steps.
1. Find $ k $ smallest distinct positive integers that are not in $ s $ . Let's call them $ u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{k} $ from the smallest to the largest.
2. Append $ u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{k} $ and $ \sum_{i=1}^{k} u_{i} $ to $ s $ in this order.
3. Go back to the first step.
Ujan will stop procrastinating when he writes the number $ n $ in the sequence $ s $ . Help him find the index of $ n $ in $ s $ . In other words, find the integer $ x $ such that $ s_{x} = n $ . It's possible to prove that all positive integers are included in $ s $ only once.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^{5} $ ), the number of test cases.
Each of the following $ t $ lines contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^{18} $ , $ 2 \le k \le 10^{6} $ ), the number to be found in the sequence $ s $ and the parameter used to create the sequence $ s $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In each of the $ t $ lines, output the answer for the corresponding test case.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, $ s = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 13, 8, 10, 18, \ldots) $ . $ 10 $ is the $ 11 $ -th number here, so the answer is $ 11 $ .
In the second sample, $ s = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 40, \ldots) $ .</div>
