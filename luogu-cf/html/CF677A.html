<h1>Vanya and Fence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个人，如果这个人的高度大于k，那么马路宽度+2，否则+1，输出最终的宽度值。
输入格式：
第一行是n和k
第二行是n个数（这个人的高度）
输出格式：
输出最终的宽度值。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya and his friends are walking along the fence of height $ h $ and they do not want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed $ h $ . If the height of some person is greater than $ h $ he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the $ i $ -th person is equal to $ a_{i} $ .
Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to $ 1 $ , while the width of the bent person is equal to $ 2 $ . Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ h $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=h<=1000 $ ) — the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=2h $ ), the $ i $ -th of them is equal to the height of the $ i $ -th person.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, only person number $ 3 $ must bend down, so the required width is equal to $ 1+1+2=4 $ .
In the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width $ 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 $ is enough.
In the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to $ 2+2+2+2+2+1=11 $ .</div>
