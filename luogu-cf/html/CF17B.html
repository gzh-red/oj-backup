<h1>Hierarchy</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述小N的公司有n个员工，每个员工i有一个初始的权值q[i]，每一个员工有且只有一个上司。
有m条申请，每个申请由三个数a[i],b[i],c[i]构成，代表将a[i]任命为b[i]的上司所需要的花费为c[i]，同时必须保证q[a[i]]>q[b[i]]。试求使每个员工(顶头上司除外)都有且只有一个上司所花费的最小代价
输入:第一行n，第二行n个数表示q[i]，第三行m,之后m行每行三个数表示a[i],b[i],c[i]
输出:一个整数表示最小代价，若无解则输出-1
1<=n<=1000
0<=m<=10000
0<=qi<=10^6
0<=ci<=10^6
1<=ai,bi<=n

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Nick's company employed $ n $ people. Now Nick needs to build a tree hierarchy of «supervisor-surbodinate» relations in the company (this is to say that each employee, except one, has exactly one supervisor). There are $ m $ applications written in the following form: «employee $ a_{i} $ is ready to become a supervisor of employee $ b_{i} $ at extra cost $ c_{i} $ ». The qualification $ q_{j} $ of each employee is known, and for each application the following is true: $ q_{ai}>q_{bi} $ .
Would you help Nick calculate the minimum cost of such a hierarchy, or find out that it is impossible to build it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — amount of employees in the company. The following line contains $ n $ space-separated numbers $ q_{j} $ ( $ 0<=q_{j}<=10^{6} $ )— the employees' qualifications. The following line contains number $ m $ ( $ 0<=m<=10000 $ ) — amount of received applications. The following $ m $ lines contain the applications themselves, each of them in the form of three space-separated numbers: $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ 0<=c_{i}<=10^{6} $ ). Different applications can be similar, i.e. they can come from one and the same employee who offered to become a supervisor of the same person but at a different cost. For each application $ q_{ai}>q_{bi} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the only line — the minimum cost of building such a hierarchy, or -1 if it is impossible to build it.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample one of the possible ways for building a hierarchy is to take applications with indexes 1, 2 and 4, which give 11 as the minimum total cost. In the second sample it is impossible to build the required hierarchy, so the answer is -1.</div>
