<h1>Inna and Candy Boxes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Inna loves sweets very much. She has $ n $ closed present boxes lines up in a row in front of her. Each of these boxes contains either a candy (Dima's work) or nothing (Sereja's work). Let's assume that the boxes are numbered from 1 to $ n $ , from left to right.
As the boxes are closed, Inna doesn't know which boxes contain candies and which boxes contain nothing. Inna chose number $ k $ and asked $ w $ questions to Dima to find that out. Each question is characterised by two integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ; $ r-l+1 $ is divisible by $ k $ ), the $ i $ -th question is: "Dima, is that true that among the boxes with numbers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ , inclusive, the candies lie only in boxes with numbers $ l_{i}+k-1 $ , $ l_{i}+2k-1 $ , $ l_{i}+3k-1 $ , ..., $ r_{i} $ ?"
Dima hates to say "no" to Inna. That's why he wonders, what number of actions he will have to make for each question to make the answer to the question positive. In one action, Dima can either secretly take the candy from any box or put a candy to any box (Dima has infinitely many candies). Help Dima count the number of actions for each Inna's question.
Please note that Dima doesn't change the array during Inna's questions. That's why when you calculate the number of operations for the current question, please assume that the sequence of boxes didn't change.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ w $ $ (1<=k<=min(n,10),1<=n,w<=10^{5}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ characters. If the $ i $ -th box contains a candy, the $ i $ -th character of the line equals 1, otherwise it equals 0.
Each of the following $ w $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n) $ — the description of the $ i $ -th question. It is guaranteed that $ r_{i}-l_{i}+1 $ is divisible by $ k $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each question, print a single number on a single line — the minimum number of operations Dima needs to make the answer to the question positive.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first question, you need to take a candy from the first box to make the answer positive. So the answer is 1.
For the second question, you need to take a candy from the first box, take a candy from the fifth box and put a candy to the sixth box. The answer is 3.
For the third question, you need to take a candy from the fifth box and put it to the sixth box. The answer is 2.</div>
