<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有个人进入一个迷宫，这个迷宫共有n+1个房间，编号从1~n+1，ta现在在第1个房间，需要到达第n+1个房间以出去。房间i有两个前进的门（来时的门不算），第一扇门通向第i+1个房间，第二扇门通向第pi(1<=pi<=i)房间，为了不迷路，这个人每到达一个房间，就会给这个房间画一个标记，画完后如果这个房间的标记数为偶数个，ta就会选择这个房间第一扇门前进，否则选择第二扇门前进。
求这个人需要通过多少道门到达终点（即第n+1个房间），答案对1000000007取模
输入：第一行一个数n，第二行n个整数pi，n和pi的含义见题目翻译
输出：一个整数，即这个人需要通过多少道门到达终点
感谢@守望 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of $ (n+1) $ rooms, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ (n+1) $ . Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the $ (n+1) $ -th one.
The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ , someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number $ (i+1) $ , also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number $ p_{i} $ , where $ 1<=p_{i}<=i $ .
In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.
- Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room $ 1 $ .
- Let's assume that Vasya is in room $ i $ and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room $ p_{i} $ ), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal.
Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room $ (n+1) $ in the end.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ) — the number of rooms. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ p_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=i $ ). Each $ p_{i} $ denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the $ i $ -th room.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
