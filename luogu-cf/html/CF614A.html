<h1>Link/Cut Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：给你一个范围[l,r]，求k的i次方在那个范围的数
感谢@Harryheqg 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Programmer Rostislav got seriously interested in the Link/Cut Tree data structure, which is based on Splay trees. Specifically, he is now studying the $ expose $ procedure.
Unfortunately, Rostislav is unable to understand the definition of this procedure, so he decided to ask programmer Serezha to help him. Serezha agreed to help if Rostislav solves a simple task (and if he doesn't, then why would he need Splay trees anyway?)
Given integers $ l $ , $ r $ and $ k $ , you need to print all powers of number $ k $ within range from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive. However, Rostislav doesn't want to spent time doing this, as he got interested in playing a network game called Agar with Gleb. Help him!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $ l $ , $ r $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=10^{18} $ , $ 2<=k<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print all powers of number $ k $ , that lie within range from $ l $ to $ r $ in the increasing order. If there are no such numbers, print "-1" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 10 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 2 4 8 </code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 4 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>-1</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Note to the first sample: numbers $ 2^{0}=1 $ , $ 2^{1}=2 $ , $ 2^{2}=4 $ , $ 2^{3}=8 $ lie within the specified range. The number $ 2^{4}=16 $ is greater then $ 10 $ , thus it shouldn't be printed.</div>
