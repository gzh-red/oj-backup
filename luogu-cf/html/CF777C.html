<h1>Alyona and Spreadsheet</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个n\*m的矩阵。对于第j列，如果满足$ \forall i \in [1,n-1],a_{i,j} \leq a_{i+1,j}$，则称这一列是不下降的。
k次询问，问如果只保留矩阵的第L~R行，矩阵中是否存在不下降的一列。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>During the lesson small girl Alyona works with one famous spreadsheet computer program and learns how to edit tables.
Now she has a table filled with integers. The table consists of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. By $ a_{i,j} $ we will denote the integer located at the $ i $ -th row and the $ j $ -th column. We say that the table is sorted in non-decreasing order in the column $ j $ if $ a_{i,j}<=a_{i+1,j} $ for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ .
Teacher gave Alyona $ k $ tasks. For each of the tasks two integers $ l $ and $ r $ are given and Alyona has to answer the following question: if one keeps the rows from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive and deletes all others, will the table be sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column? Formally, does there exist such $ j $ that $ a_{i,j}<=a_{i+1,j} $ for all $ i $ from $ l $ to $ r-1 $ inclusive.
Alyona is too small to deal with this task and asks you to help!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n·m<=100000 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the table respectively. Note that your are given a constraint that bound the product of these two integers, i.e. the number of elements in the table.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains $ m $ integers. The $ j $ -th integers in the $ i $ of these lines stands for $ a_{i,j} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i,j}<=10^{9} $ ).
The next line of the input contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=100000 $ ) — the number of task that teacher gave to Alyona.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ k $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Yes" to the $ i $ -th line of the output if the table consisting of rows from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ inclusive is sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column. Otherwise, print "No".</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the sample, the whole table is not sorted in any column. However, rows 1–3 are sorted in column $ 1 $ , while rows 4–5 are sorted in column $ 3 $ .</div>
