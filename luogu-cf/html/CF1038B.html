<h1>Non-Coprime Partition</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目大意：
给定一个整数$n$，要求把$1$到$n$分别放入两个序列$s1,s2$，使得$\gcd(sum(s1),sum(s2))>1$
### 输入格式：
一个整数$n$
### 输出格式：
如果不能构成符合条件的序列，输出"No"，否则输出"Yes"，并在下两行输出$s1,s2$
```

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Find out if it is possible to partition the first $ n $ positive integers into two non-empty disjoint sets $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $ such that:
$ \mathrm{gcd}(\mathrm{sum}(S_1), \mathrm{sum}(S_2)) > 1 $ Here $ \mathrm{sum}(S) $ denotes the sum of all elements present in set $ S $ and $ \mathrm{gcd} $ means the[greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
Every integer number from $ 1 $ to $ n $ should be present in exactly one of $ S_1 $ or $ S_2 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 45\,000 $ )</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If such partition doesn't exist, print "No" (quotes for clarity).
Otherwise, print "Yes" (quotes for clarity), followed by two lines, describing $ S_1 $ and $ S_2 $ respectively.
Each set description starts with the set size, followed by the elements of the set in any order. Each set must be non-empty.
If there are multiple possible partitions — print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>No</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Yes
1 2
2 1 3 
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, there is no way to partition a single number into two non-empty sets, hence the answer is "No".
In the second example, the sums of the sets are $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ respectively. The $ \mathrm{gcd}(2, 4) = 2 > 1 $ , hence that is one of the possible answers.</div>
