<h1>Minimal Labels</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a directed acyclic graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges between any pair of vertices. Graph can be disconnected.
You should assign labels to all vertices in such a way that:
- Labels form a valid permutation of length $ n $ — an integer sequence such that each integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ appears exactly once in it.
- If there exists an edge from vertex $ v $ to vertex $ u $ then $ label_{v} $ should be smaller than $ label_{u} $ .
- Permutation should be lexicographically smallest among all suitable.
Find such sequence of labels to satisfy all the conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},1<=m<=10^{5} $ ).
Next $ m $ lines contain two integer numbers $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1<=v,u<=n,v≠u $ ) — edges of the graph. Edges are directed, graph doesn't contain loops or multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ numbers — lexicographically smallest correct permutation of labels of vertices.</div>
