<h1>Perpetual Motion Machine</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
有$n$台机器，每个机器有一个设定值$d_i$，它可以定为任意非负整数。当某一台机器的设定值为$d_i$时，它每秒会消耗$d_i^2$的能量，如果某一对机器$y,z$通过电线直接连接，每秒会产生$d_y \times d_z$的能量。
现在，给出机器和电线的连接情况，试问是否存在一种设定$n$个机器的设定值的方案，使得$\exists i,d_i \neq 0$且能量的总生产值大于等于总消耗值。
输入数据
第一行一个正整数表示测试数据组数
在每一个测试数据之前有一个空行。每一个测试数据的第一行为两个整数$n,m(1 \leq n \leq 10^5 , 0 \leq m \leq 10^5)$表示机器的数量与电线的数量
接下来$m$行每行两个正整数$u,v(1 \leq u,v \leq n , u \neq v)$描述一条电线。数据保证不会存在两条电线两端的机器编号相同
输出数据
对于每一个输入数据，如果存在满足题意的设定，第一行输出$Yes$，第二行输出$n$个非负整数表示你所设定的设定值。注意设定值中至少要有一个数为正整数。如果不存在，输出一行$No$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Developer Petr thinks that he invented a perpetual motion machine. Namely, he has a lot of elements, which work in the following way.
Each element has one controller that can be set to any non-negative real value. If a controller is set on some value $ x $ , then the controller consumes $ x^{2} $ energy units per second. At the same time, any two elements connected by a wire produce $ y·z $ energy units per second, where $ y $ and $ z $ are the values set on their controllers.
Petr has only a limited number of wires, so he has already built some scheme of elements and wires, and is now interested if it's possible to set the controllers in such a way that the system produces at least as much power as it consumes, and at least one controller is set on the value different from $ 0 $ . Help him check this, and if it's possible, find the required integer values that should be set.
It is guaranteed that if there exist controllers' settings satisfying the above conditions, then there exist required integer values not greater than $ 10^{6} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are several (at least one) test cases in the input. The first line contains single integer — the number of test cases.
There is an empty line before each test case. The first line of test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of elements in the scheme and the number of wires.
After that, $ m $ lines follow, each of them contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=n $ ) — two elements connected by a wire. No element is connected with itself, no two elements are connected by more than one wire.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ and the sum of $ m $ over all test cases do not exceed $ 10^{5} $ .
For hacks you can only use tests with one test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print answer for each test case.
For each test case print "YES" if it's possible to set the controllers in such a way that the consumed power is not greater than the power produced, and the required values on the next line. The settings should be integers from $ 0 $ to $ 10^{6} $ , inclusive, and at least one value should be different from $ 0 $ . If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
If it's not possible to set the controllers in the required way, print one line "NO".</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it's possible to set the controllers in the required way, for example, in the following way: set $ 1 $ on the first element, set $ 2 $ on the second and on the third, set $ 1 $ on the fourth. The consumed power is then equal to $ 1^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}=10 $ energy units per second, the produced power is equal to $ 1·2+2·2+2·1+2·1=10 $ energy units per second. Thus the answer is "YES".
In the second test case it's not possible to set the controllers in the required way. For example, if we set all controllers to $ 0.5 $ , then the consumed powers equals $ 0.75 $ energy units per second, while produced power equals $ 0.5 $ energy units per second.</div>
