<h1>Closest Equals</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ and $ m $ queries $ l_{j},r_{j} $ ( $ 1<=l_{j}<=r_{j}<=n $ ). For each query you need to print the minimum distance between such pair of elements $ a_{x} $ and $ a_{y} $ ( $ x≠y $ ), that:
- both indexes of the elements lie within range \[ $ l_{j},r_{j} $ \], that is, $ l_{j}<=x,y<=r_{j} $ ;
- the values of the elements are equal, that is $ a_{x}=a_{y} $ .
The text above understands distance as $ |x-y| $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a pair of integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=5·10^{5} $ ) — the length of the sequence and the number of queries, correspondingly.
The second line contains the sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).
Next $ m $ lines contain the queries, one per line. Each query is given by a pair of numbers $ l_{j},r_{j} $ ( $ 1<=l_{j}<=r_{j}<=n $ ) — the indexes of the query range limits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ integers — the answers to each query. If there is no valid match for some query, please print -1 as an answer to this query.</div>
