<h1>Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个序列，每次操作可以把某个数+1-1。要求把序列变成非降数列。而且要求修改后的数列只能出现修改前的数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Petya likes to play very much. And most of all he likes to play the following game:
He is given a sequence of $ N $ integer numbers. At each step it is allowed to increase the value of any number by $ 1 $ or to decrease it by $ 1 $ . The goal of the game is to make the sequence non-decreasing with the smallest number of steps. Petya is not good at math, so he asks for your help.
The sequence $ a $ is called non-decreasing if $ a_{1}<=a_{2}<=...<=a_{N} $ holds, where $ N $ is the length of the sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains single integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=5000 $ ) — the length of the initial sequence. The following $ N $ lines contain one integer each — elements of the sequence. These numbers do not exceed $ 10^{9} $ by absolute value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer — minimum number of steps required to achieve the goal.</div>
