<h1>Shark</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>科学家们研究鲨鱼的习性已经有一段很长的时间了。鲨鱼，就像其他的生物一样，在某一地点交替短途移动, 并在不同地点之间长途移动。
Max 是一位年轻的生物学家。他观察一只特别的鲨鱼已有 $n$ 天，现在他也清楚地知道这只鲨鱼在某一天游动的距离。每天鲨鱼游动的距离都是不同的。Max 想知道鲨鱼抵达了多少个位置。他假定：如果鲨鱼在某天游动的距离严格小于 $k$，那么它的位置不发生变化；否则，如果鲨鱼在某天游动的距离大于或等于 $k$，则它的位置在那天发生了变化。注意：有可能鲨鱼的位置连续几天都发生了变化，只要这几天每天鲨鱼游动的距离都至少为 $k$。
从某个地方游走后，鲨鱼就不会再回来了。也就是说，我们可以将这个 $n$ 天的序列划分成若干断连续的、非空子段，使得每一子段内每天鲨鱼游动的距离都小于 $k$，那么每一个子段就代表一个位置。Max 想找出这样的 $k$，使得每个子段的长度都相等。
找到这样的整数 $k$，令位置的数量尽可能地多。如果存在多个满足条件的 $k$，输出最小的一个。
## 输入格式
第一行，一个整数 $n$（$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$），表示天数。
第二行，$n$ 个互不相等的整数 $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$（$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$），表示每天游动的距离。
## 输出格式
输出一个整数 $k$，使得
1. 鲨鱼在每个位置停留的天数相同；
2. 在满足第一个条件的情况下位置的数量尽可能多；
3. 在满足第一和第二个条件的情况下 $k$ 尽可能小。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For long time scientists study the behavior of sharks. Sharks, as many other species, alternate short movements in a certain location and long movements between locations.
Max is a young biologist. For $ n $ days he watched a specific shark, and now he knows the distance the shark traveled in each of the days. All the distances are distinct. Max wants to know now how many locations the shark visited. He assumed there is such an integer $ k $ that if the shark in some day traveled the distance strictly less than $ k $ , then it didn't change the location; otherwise, if in one day the shark traveled the distance greater than or equal to $ k $ ; then it was changing a location in that day. Note that it is possible that the shark changed a location for several consecutive days, in each of them the shark traveled the distance at least $ k $ .
The shark never returned to the same location after it has moved from it. Thus, in the sequence of $ n $ days we can find consecutive nonempty segments when the shark traveled the distance less than $ k $ in each of the days: each such segment corresponds to one location. Max wants to choose such $ k $ that the lengths of all such segments are equal.
Find such integer $ k $ , that the number of locations is as large as possible. If there are several such $ k $ , print the smallest one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ ) — the number of days.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct positive integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 $ ) — the distance traveled in each of the day.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer $ k $ , such that
1. the shark was in each location the same number of days,
2. the number of locations is maximum possible satisfying the first condition,
3. $ k $ is smallest possible satisfying the first and second conditions.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the shark travels inside a location on days $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ (first location), then on $ 4 $ -th and $ 5 $ -th days (second location), then on $ 7 $ -th and $ 8 $ -th days (third location). There are three locations in total.
In the second example the shark only moves inside a location on the $ 2 $ -nd day, so there is only one location.</div>
