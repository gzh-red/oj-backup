<h1>Roma and Poker</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Each evening Roma plays online poker on his favourite website. The rules of poker on this website are a bit strange: there are always two players in a hand, there are no bets, and the winner takes $ 1 $ virtual bourle from the loser.
Last evening Roma started to play poker. He decided to spend no more than $ k $ virtual bourles — he will stop immediately if the number of his loses exceeds the number of his wins by $ k $ . Also Roma will leave the game if he wins enough money for the evening, i.e. if the number of wins exceeds the number of loses by $ k $ .
Next morning Roma found a piece of paper with a sequence on it representing his results. Roma doesn't remember the results exactly, and some characters in the sequence are written in a way such that it's impossible to recognize this character, so Roma can't recall whether he won $ k $ bourles or he lost.
The sequence written by Roma is a string $ s $ consisting of characters W (Roma won the corresponding hand), L (Roma lost), D (draw) and ? (unknown result). Roma wants to restore any valid sequence by changing all ? characters to W, L or D. The sequence is called valid if all these conditions are met:
- In the end the absolute difference between the number of wins and loses is equal to $ k $ ;
- There is no hand such that the absolute difference before this hand was equal to $ k $ .
Help Roma to restore any such sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two numbers $ n $ (the length of Roma's sequence) and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=1000 $ ).
The second line contains the sequence $ s $ consisting of characters W, L, D and ?. There are exactly $ n $ characters in this sequence.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no valid sequence that can be obtained from $ s $ by replacing all ? characters by W, L or D, print NO.
Otherwise print this sequence. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
