<h1>Telephone Number</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一共有 $t$ 组测试数据，每组测试数据有一个 $n$ 位数，问能否去掉其中的一些数字使这个数变成首位数为8的11位数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A telephone number is a sequence of exactly 11 digits, where the first digit is 8. For example, the sequence 80011223388 is a telephone number, but the sequences 70011223388 and 80000011223388 are not.
You are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of digits.
In one operation you can delete any character from string $ s $ . For example, it is possible to obtain strings 112, 111 or 121 from string 1121.
You need to determine whether there is such a sequence of operations (possibly empty), after which the string $ s $ becomes a telephone number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the length of string $ s $ .
The second line of each test case contains the string $ s $ ( $ |s| = n $ ) consisting of digits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test print one line.
If there is a sequence of operations, after which $ s $ becomes a telephone number, print YES.
Otherwise, print NO.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>

NO

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case you need to delete the first and the third digits. Then the string 7818005553535 becomes 88005553535.</div>
