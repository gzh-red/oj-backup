<h1>Chattering</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ parrots standing in a circle. Each parrot has a certain level of respect among other parrots, namely $ r_i $ . When a parrot with respect level $ x $ starts chattering, $ x $ neighbours to the right and to the left of it start repeating the same words in 1 second. Their neighbours then start repeating as well, and so on, until all the birds begin to chatter.
You are given the respect levels of all parrots. For each parrot answer a question: if this certain parrot starts chattering, how many seconds will pass until all other birds will start repeating it?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input there is a single integer $ n $ , the number of parrots ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ ).
In the next line of input there are $ n $ integers $ r_1 $ , ..., $ r_n $ , the respect levels of parrots in order they stand in the circle ( $ 1 \leq r_i \leq n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers. $ i $ -th of them should equal the number of seconds that is needed for all parrots to start chattering if the $ i $ -th parrot is the first to start.</div>
