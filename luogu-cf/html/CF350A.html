<h1>TL</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Valera wanted to prepare a Codesecrof round. He's already got one problem and he wants to set a time limit (TL) on it.
Valera has written $ n $ correct solutions. For each correct solution, he knows its running time (in seconds). Valera has also wrote $ m $ wrong solutions and for each wrong solution he knows its running time (in seconds).
Let's suppose that Valera will set $ v $ seconds TL in the problem. Then we can say that a solution passes the system testing if its running time is at most $ v $ seconds. We can also say that a solution passes the system testing with some "extra" time if for its running time, $ a $ seconds, an inequality $ 2a<=v $ holds.
As a result, Valera decided to set $ v $ seconds TL, that the following conditions are met:
1. $ v $ is a positive integer;
2. all correct solutions pass the system testing;
3. at least one correct solution passes the system testing with some "extra" time;
4. all wrong solutions do not pass the system testing;
5. value $ v $ is minimum among all TLs, for which points $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ hold.
Help Valera and find the most suitable TL or else state that such TL doesn't exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=100 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=100 $ ) — the running time of each of the $ n $ correct solutions in seconds. The third line contains $ m $ space-separated positive integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=100 $ ) — the running time of each of $ m $ wrong solutions in seconds.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is a valid TL value, print it. Otherwise, print -1.</div>
