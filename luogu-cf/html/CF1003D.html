<h1>Coins and Queries</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>n个硬币，q次询问。第二行给你n个硬币的面值（保证都是2的次幂！）。每次询问组成b块钱，最少需要多少个硬币？
感谢@mzjmzj666 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp has $ n $ coins, the value of the $ i $ -th coin is $ a_i $ . It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of $ 2 $ (i.e. $ a_i = 2^d $ for some non-negative integer number $ d $ ).
Polycarp wants to know answers on $ q $ queries. The $ j $ -th query is described as integer number $ b_j $ . The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value $ b_j $ using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value $ b_j $ , the answer to the $ j $ -th query is -1.
The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of coins and the number of queries.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ — values of coins ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 $ ). It is guaranteed that all $ a_i $ are integer powers of $ 2 $ (i.e. $ a_i = 2^d $ for some non-negative integer number $ d $ ).
The next $ q $ lines contain one integer each. The $ j $ -th line contains one integer $ b_j $ — the value of the $ j $ -th query ( $ 1 \le b_j \le 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers $ ans_j $ . The $ j $ -th integer must be equal to the answer on the $ j $ -th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value $ b_j $ the answer to the $ j $ -th query is -1.</div>
