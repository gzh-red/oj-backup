<h1>Interval Coloring</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Aryo has got a lot of intervals for his $ 2418 $ th birthday. He is really excited and decided to color all these intervals with some colors. He has a simple rule for himself. He calls a coloring nice if there exists no three intervals $ a,b $ and $ c $ such that the following conditions are satisfied simultaneously:
- $ a,b $ and $ c $ are colored with the same color,
- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF100J/ed0aef02d05d82b4865ec07a27c9dc3c56ae3f10.png),

Moreover he found out that for every intervals $ i $ and $ j $ , there is at least one point in $ i $ which isn't in $ j $ .
Given some set of intervals. You have to find the minimum number $ k $ , such that Aryo can find a nice coloring with $ k $ colors.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ), number of intervals.
The following $ n $ lines contain a interval description each. Each interval is described by two numbers $ s_{i},e_{i} $ which are the start and end points of it ( $ -10^{5}<s_{i},e_{i}<10^{5} $ , $ s_{i}<=e_{i} $ ). See samples for clarity. A square bracket stands for including of the corresponding endpoint, while a round bracket stands for excluding.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Write a single integer $ k $ — the minimum number of colors needed for a nice coloring.</div>
