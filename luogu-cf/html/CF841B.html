<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 翻译
有两个人，他们面对一个数组，轮流取数组里的数， 第一个取的人要在这个数组里选择一个长度非零的子段，且其和为奇数，这个人要把他选定的子段删掉，并把原子段黏合。而第二个人的操作跟第一个人类似，只是和要是偶数。胜负的判定就是谁最先没法行动谁就输。
###输入格式
第一行是一个数n，表示数组里的数的个数 第二行是n个数，表示数组里的数
### 输出格式
第一个人赢输出“First”，否则输出“Second”

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leha somehow found an array consisting of $ n $ integers. Looking at it, he came up with a task. Two players play the game on the array. Players move one by one. The first player can choose for his move a subsegment of non-zero length with an odd sum of numbers and remove it from the array, after that the remaining parts are glued together into one array and the game continues. The second player can choose a subsegment of non-zero length with an even sum and remove it. Loses the one who can not make a move. Who will win if both play optimally?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input data contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ) — length of the array.
Next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output answer in single line. "First", if first player wins, and "Second" otherwise (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
1 3 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>First
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2
2 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Second
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first sample first player remove whole array in one move and win.
In second sample first player can't make a move and lose.</div>
