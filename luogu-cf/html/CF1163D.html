<h1>Mysterious Code</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个字符串$c$($0<=|c|<=1000$),$c$由$*$和小写字母组成，你可以给$*$填上任何一个小写字母
再给定两个字符串$s$,$t$,$(0<=|s|,|t|<=50)$,求如何填$c$中的$*$,使得$c$中包含$s$的次数-$c$中包含$t$的次数最大</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>During a normal walk in the forest, Katie has stumbled upon a mysterious code! However, the mysterious code had some characters unreadable. She has written down this code as a string $ c $ consisting of lowercase English characters and asterisks ("\*"), where each of the asterisks denotes an unreadable character. Excited with her discovery, Katie has decided to recover the unreadable characters by replacing each asterisk with arbitrary lowercase English letter (different asterisks might be replaced with different letters).
Katie has a favorite string $ s $ and a not-so-favorite string $ t $ and she would love to recover the mysterious code so that it has as many occurrences of $ s $ as possible and as little occurrences of $ t $ as possible. Formally, let's denote $ f(x, y) $ as the number of occurrences of $ y $ in $ x $ (for example, $ f(aababa, ab) = 2 $ ). Katie wants to recover the code $ c' $ conforming to the original $ c $ , such that $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) $ is largest possible. However, Katie is not very good at recovering codes in general, so she would like you to help her out.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains string $ c $ ( $ 1 \leq |c| \leq 1000 $ ) — the mysterious code . It is guaranteed that $ c $ consists of lowercase English characters and asterisks "\*" only.
The second and third line contain strings $ s $ and $ t $ respectively ( $ 1 \leq |s|, |t| \leq 50 $ , $ s \neq t $ ). It is guaranteed that $ s $ and $ t $ consist of lowercase English characters only.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the largest possible value of $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) $ of the recovered code.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, for $ c' $ equal to "katie" $ f(c', s) = 1 $ and $ f(c', t) = 0 $ , which makes $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) = 1 $ which is the largest possible.
In the second example, the only $ c' $ conforming to the given $ c $ is "caat". The corresponding $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) = 1 - 2 = -1 $ .
In the third example, there are multiple ways to recover the code such that $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) $ is largest possible, for example "aaa", "aac", or even "zaz". The value of $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) = 0 $ for all of these recovered codes.
In the fourth example, the optimal recovered code $ c' $ would be "ccc". The corresponding $ f(c', s) - f(c', t) = 2 $ .</div>
