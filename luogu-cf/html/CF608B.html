<h1>Hamming Distance Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Genos needs your help. He was asked to solve the following programming problem by Saitama:
The length of some string $ s $ is denoted $ |s| $ . The Hamming distance between two strings $ s $ and $ t $ of equal length is defined as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF608B/26f9df019bcbe60126623115c0e18c5a58de8eee.png), where $ s_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th character of $ s $ and $ t_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th character of $ t $ . For example, the Hamming distance between string "0011" and string "0110" is $ |0-0|+|0-1|+|1-1|+|1-0|=0+1+0+1=2 $ .
Given two binary strings $ a $ and $ b $ , find the sum of the Hamming distances between $ a $ and all contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains binary string $ a $ ( $ 1<=|a|<=200000 $ ).
The second line of the input contains binary string $ b $ ( $ |a|<=|b|<=200000 $ ).
Both strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the sum of Hamming distances between $ a $ and all contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>01
00111
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0011
0110
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample case, there are four contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ : "00", "01", "11", and "11". The distance between "01" and "00" is $ |0-0|+|1-0|=1 $ . The distance between "01" and "01" is $ |0-0|+|1-1|=0 $ . The distance between "01" and "11" is $ |0-1|+|1-1|=1 $ . Last distance counts twice, as there are two occurrences of string "11". The sum of these edit distances is $ 1+0+1+1=3 $ .
The second sample case is described in the statement.</div>
