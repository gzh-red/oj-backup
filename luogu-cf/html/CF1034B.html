<h1>Little C Loves 3 II</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意：**
给定一个$n\times m$的棋盘，每次可以在上面放一对棋子$(x,y)(x',y')$，要求$\mid x-x'\mid+\mid y-y'\mid==3$，问最多可以放多少**个**棋子
**输入格式：**
一行两个整数$n,m$
**输出格式：**
一个整数，表示最多能放多少个棋子</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little C loves number «3» very much. He loves all things about it.
Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $ n \times m $ . The cell in the $ x $ -th row and in the $ y $ -th column is called $ (x,y) $ . Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $ 3 $ . The Manhattan distance between two cells $ (x_i,y_i) $ and $ (x_j,y_j) $ is defined as $ |x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j| $ .
He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \leq n,m \leq 10^9 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the chessboard.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the maximum number of chessmen Little C can place.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>8</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the Manhattan distance between any two cells is smaller than $ 3 $ , so the answer is $ 0 $ .
In the second example, a possible solution is $ (1,1)(3,2) $ , $ (1,2)(3,3) $ , $ (2,1)(1,3) $ , $ (3,1)(2,3) $ .</div>
