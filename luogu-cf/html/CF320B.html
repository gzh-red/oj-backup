<h1>Ping-Pong (Easy Version)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有一些区间，你可以将区间 $(a, b)$ 移动到区间 $(c, d)$ 当且仅当 c < a < d 或 c < b < d ，如果从区间
$I_1$ 开始存在一个连续的“移动序列”可以到达 $I_2$，那么就有一条从 $I_1$ 到 $I_2$ 的路径。
你需要处理下列两种操作：
1. “1 x y” (x < y)，添加一个新区间 $(x, y)$，保证新区间的长度严格大于之前所有区间。
2. “2 a b”，回答询问：是否存在从第 a 个（添加的）区间到第 b 个区间的路径。从 1 开始计数。
注意，最开始没有区间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem at each moment you have a set of intervals. You can move from interval $ (a,b) $ from our set to interval $ (c,d) $ from our set if and only if $ c&lt;a&lt;d $ or $ c&lt;b&lt;d $ . Also there is a path from interval $ I_{1} $ from our set to interval $ I_{2} $ from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from $ I_{1} $ so that we can reach $ I_{2} $ .
Your program should handle the queries of the following two types:
1. "1 x y" $ (x&lt;y) $ — add the new interval $ (x,y) $ to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals.
2. "2 a b" $ (a≠b) $ — answer the question: is there a path from $ a $ -th (one-based) added interval to $ b $ -th (one-based) added interval?
Answer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ denoting the number of queries, $ (1<=n<=100) $ . Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed $ 10^{9} $ by their absolute value.
It's guaranteed that all queries are correct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of the second type print "YES" or "NO" on a separate line depending on the answer.</div>
