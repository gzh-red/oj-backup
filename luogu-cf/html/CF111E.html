<h1>Petya and Rectangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Petya loves playing with rectangles. Mom bought Petya a rectangle divided into cells $ n×m $ in size (containing $ n $ rows, $ m $ columns). Petya marked two different cells of the rectangle and now he is solving the following task:
Let's define a simple path between those two cells as a sequence of distinct cells $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ , where $ a_{1} $ and $ a_{k} $ are the two marked cells. Besides, $ a_{i} $ and $ a_{i+1} $ are side-neighboring cells of the path ( $ 1<=i&lt;k $ ). Let's denote the path length as number $ k $ (the sequence length).
Petya's task is to find the longest simple path's length and to print the path. Help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 4<=n,m<=1000 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the rectangle, correspondingly. The second line contains space-separated integers $ x_{1} $ and $ y_{1} $ — the coordinates of the first marked cell. The third line contains space-separated integers $ x_{2} $ $ y_{2} $ — the coordinates of the second marked cell ( $ 1&lt;x_{1},x_{2}&lt;n,1&lt;y_{1},y_{2}&lt;m,x_{1}≠x_{2},y_{1}≠y_{2} $ ).
The coordinates of a marked cell are a pair of integers $ x $ $ y $ , where $ x $ represents the row's number and $ y $ represents the column's number. The rows are numbered from top to bottom with consecutive integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The columns are numbered from the left to the right by consecutive integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .
It is guaranteed that the marked cells are not positioned in one row or column.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the length of the found path — $ k $ . In the next lines print $ k $ pairs of integers, one per line — coordinates of the cells that constitute the found path in the order, in which they follow in the path (the path must go from cell $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to cell $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ ). If there are several solutions, print any of them.</div>
