<h1>Mister B and Angle in Polygon</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>On one quiet day all of sudden Mister B decided to draw angle $ a $ on his field. Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex $ n $ -gon (regular convex polygon with $ n $ sides).
That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices $ v_{1} $ , $ v_{2} $ , $ v_{3} $ such that the angle ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF820B/6d6c5a52027f58c108350561b7ff23e63c6d24de.png) (where $ v_{2} $ is the vertex of the angle, and $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{3} $ lie on its sides) is as close as possible to $ a $ . In other words, the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF820B/1f65cda47093761b7aa9cbd2b73454017bbcd824.png) should be minimum possible.
If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First and only line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ a $ ( $ 3<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 1<=a<=180 $ ) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print three space-separated integers: the vertices $ v_{1} $ , $ v_{2} $ , $ v_{3} $ , which form ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF820B/6d6c5a52027f58c108350561b7ff23e63c6d24de.png). If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in clockwise order.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of $ 60 $ degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.
Vertices of square can create $ 45 $ or $ 90 $ degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of $ 45 $ degrees was chosen, since $ |45-67|&lt;|90-67| $ . Other correct answers are: "3 1 2", "3 2 4", "4 2 3", "4 3 1", "1 3 4", "1 4 2", "2 4 1", "4 1 3", "3 1 4", "3 4 2", "2 4 3", "2 3 1", "1 3 2", "1 2 4", "4 2 1".
In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of $ 90 $ degrees was chosen, since $ |90-68|&lt;|45-68| $ . Other correct answers are: "2 1 4", "3 2 1", "1 2 3", "4 3 2", "2 3 4", "1 4 3", "3 4 1".</div>
