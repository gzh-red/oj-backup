<h1>Pavel and barbecue</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Pavel cooks barbecue. There are $ n $ skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of $ n $ positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of $ n $ positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.
Pavel has a plan: a permutation $ p $ and a sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position $ i $ to position $ p_{i} $ , and if $ b_{i} $ equals $ 1 $ then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.
Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation $ p $ and sequence $ b $ suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation $ p $ and the given sequence $ b $ he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of $ 2n $ placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.
There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation $ p $ and a sequence $ b $ suit him if there is an integer $ k $ ( $ k>=2n $ ), so that after $ k $ seconds each skewer visits each of the $ 2n $ placements.
It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation $ p $ and sequence $ b $ exists for any $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contain the integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of skewers.
The second line contains a sequence of integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ ) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.
The third line contains a sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation $ p $ and the given sequence $ b $ he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of $ 2n $ placements.</div>
