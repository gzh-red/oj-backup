<h1>Olya and Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Olya has got a directed non-weighted graph, consisting of $ n $ vertexes and $ m $ edges. We will consider that the graph vertexes are indexed from 1 to $ n $ in some manner. Then for any graph edge that goes from vertex $ v $ to vertex $ u $ the following inequation holds: $ v&lt;u $ .
Now Olya wonders, how many ways there are to add an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of edges to the graph so as the following conditions were met:
1. You can reach vertexes number $ i+1,i+2,...,n $ from any vertex number $ i $ $ (i&lt;n) $ .
2. For any graph edge going from vertex $ v $ to vertex $ u $ the following inequation fulfills: $ v&lt;u $ .
3. There is at most one edge between any two vertexes.
4. The shortest distance between the pair of vertexes $ i,j $ $ (i&lt;j) $ , for which $ j-i<=k $ holds, equals $ j-i $ edges.
5. The shortest distance between the pair of vertexes $ i,j $ $ (i&lt;j) $ , for which $ j-i&gt;k $ holds, equals either $ j-i $ or $ j-i-k $ edges.
We will consider two ways distinct, if there is the pair of vertexes $ i,j $ $ (i&lt;j) $ , such that first resulting graph has an edge from $ i $ to $ j $ and the second one doesn't have it.
Help Olya. As the required number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n,m,k $ $ (2<=n<=10^{6},0<=m<=10^{5},1<=k<=10^{6}) $ .
The next $ m $ lines contain the description of the edges of the initial graph. The $ i $ -th line contains a pair of space-separated integers $ u_{i},v_{i} $ $ (1<=u_{i}&lt;v_{i}<=n) $ — the numbers of vertexes that have a directed edge from $ u_{i} $ to $ v_{i} $ between them.
It is guaranteed that any pair of vertexes $ u_{i},v_{i} $ has at most one edge between them. It also is guaranteed that the graph edges are given in the order of non-decreasing $ u_{i} $ . If there are multiple edges going from vertex $ u_{i} $ , then it is guaranteed that these edges are given in the order of increasing $ v_{i} $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
