<h1>Word Correction</h1>
<h2>题目背景</h2>
<div>给一个长为n的字符串，当有两个元音字母相邻时，删除后一个元音，输出修改后的字符串。（注：a,e,i,o,u,y为元音字母）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Victor tries to write his own text editor, with word correction included. However, the rules of word correction are really strange.
Victor thinks that if a word contains two consecutive vowels, then it's kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it is considered to be correct.
You are given a word $ s $ . Can you predict what will it become after correction?
In this problem letters a, e, i, o, u and y are considered to be vowels.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of letters in word $ s $ before the correction.
The second line contains a string $ s $ consisting of exactly $ n $ lowercase Latin letters — the word before the correction.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the word $ s $ after the correction.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Explanations of the examples:
1. There is only one replace: weird ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF938A/5a518872d8942914aef6c33d251688a64a8d6d74.png) werd;
2. No replace needed since there are no two consecutive vowels;
3. aaeaa ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF938A/5a518872d8942914aef6c33d251688a64a8d6d74.png)aeaa ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF938A/5a518872d8942914aef6c33d251688a64a8d6d74.png)aaa ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF938A/5a518872d8942914aef6c33d251688a64a8d6d74.png)aa ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF938A/5a518872d8942914aef6c33d251688a64a8d6d74.png) a.</div>
