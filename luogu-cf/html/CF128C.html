<h1>Games with Rectangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this task Anna and Maria play the following game. Initially they have a checkered piece of paper with a painted $ n×m $ rectangle (only the border, no filling). Anna and Maria move in turns and Anna starts. During each move one should paint inside the last-painted rectangle a new lesser rectangle (along the grid lines). The new rectangle should have no common points with the previous one. Note that when we paint a rectangle, we always paint only the border, the rectangles aren't filled.
Nobody wins the game — Anna and Maria simply play until they have done $ k $ moves in total. Count the number of different ways to play this game.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains three integers: $ n,m,k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single number — the number of the ways to play the game. As this number can be very big, print the value modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Two ways to play the game are considered different if the final pictures are different. In other words, if one way contains a rectangle that is not contained in the other way.
In the first sample Anna, who performs her first and only move, has only one possible action plan — insert a $ 1×1 $ square inside the given $ 3×3 $ square.
In the second sample Anna has as much as 9 variants: 4 ways to paint a $ 1×1 $ square, 2 ways to insert a $ 1×2 $ rectangle vertically, 2 more ways to insert it horizontally and one more way is to insert a $ 2×2 $ square.</div>
