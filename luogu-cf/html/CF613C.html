<h1>Necklace</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan wants to make a necklace as a present to his beloved girl. A necklace is a cyclic sequence of beads of different colors. Ivan says that necklace is beautiful relative to the cut point between two adjacent beads, if the chain of beads remaining after this cut is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF613C/f0403ee8a9ea8e51a7dc66253e50c2d1edfa6bff.png)Ivan has beads of $ n $ colors. He wants to make a necklace, such that it's beautiful relative to as many cuts as possible. He certainly wants to use all the beads. Help him to make the most beautiful necklace.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=26 $ ) — the number of colors of beads. The second line contains after $ n $ positive integers $ a_{i} $ — the quantity of beads of $ i $ -th color. It is guaranteed that the sum of $ a_{i} $ is at least 2 and does not exceed $ 100000 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print a single number — the maximum number of beautiful cuts that a necklace composed from given beads may have. In the second line print any example of such necklace.
Each color of the beads should be represented by the corresponding lowercase English letter (starting with a). As the necklace is cyclic, print it starting from any point.</div>
