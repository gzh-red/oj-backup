<h1>Alice and the Unfair Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>本题翻译来自 @ljc20020730
现在有$n$个盒子和$m$次操作。，第$i$次操作Alice会询问第$a_i$个盒子里是否有小球。
为了避免Alice获得胜利，Marisa会在每一次操作之前可以将藏着小球的盒子移到相邻的盒子。
记$(x,y)$表示一开始Marisa将小球放在$x$号盒子，最终小球在$y$号盒子的一次游戏。
询问所有合法的$(x,y)$的有序对，使得Marisa获得胜利。
对于$100\%$的数据满足$1 \leq n,m \leq 10^5$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice is playing a game with her good friend, Marisa.
There are $ n $ boxes arranged in a line, numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. Marisa will hide a doll in one of the boxes. Then Alice will have $ m $ chances to guess where the doll is. If Alice will correctly guess the number of box, where doll is now, she will win the game, otherwise, her friend will win the game.
In order to win, Marisa will use some unfair tricks. After each time Alice guesses a box, she can move the doll to the neighboring box or just keep it at its place. Boxes $ i $ and $ i + 1 $ are neighboring for all $ 1 \leq i \leq n - 1 $ . She can also use this trick once before the game starts.
So, the game happens in this order: the game starts, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the first guess, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the second guess, Marisa makes the trick, $ \ldots $ , Alice makes $ m $ -th guess, Marisa makes the trick, the game ends.
Alice has come up with a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m $ . In the $ i $ -th guess, she will ask if the doll is in the box $ a_i $ . She wants to know the number of scenarios $ (x, y) $ (for all $ 1 \leq x, y \leq n $ ), such that Marisa can win the game if she will put the doll at the $ x $ -th box at the beginning and at the end of the game, the doll will be at the $ y $ -th box. Help her and calculate this number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ , separated by space ( $ 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 $ ) — the number of boxes and the number of guesses, which Alice will make.
The next line contains $ m $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m $ , separated by spaces ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq n $ ), the number $ a_i $ means the number of the box which Alice will guess in the $ i $ -th guess.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of scenarios in a single line, or the number of pairs of boxes $ (x, y) $ ( $ 1 \leq x, y \leq n $ ), such that if Marisa will put the doll into the box with number $ x $ , she can make tricks in such way, that at the end of the game the doll will be in the box with number $ y $ and she will win the game.</div>

<div>In the first example, the possible scenarios are $ (1, 1) $ , $ (1, 2) $ , $ (2, 1) $ , $ (2, 2) $ , $ (2, 3) $ , $ (3, 2) $ , $ (3, 3) $ .
Let's take $ (2, 2) $ as an example. The boxes, in which the doll will be during the game can be $ 2 \to 3 \to 3 \to 3 \to 2 $</div>
