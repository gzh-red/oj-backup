<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
一只青蛙现在在一个数轴上，它现在要从点 $1$ 跳到点 $n$ ，它每次可以向右跳不超过 $d$ 个单位。比如，它可以从点 $x$ 跳到点 $x+a$ $( 1<=a<=d )$ 。特别的，青蛙只能在有百合花的点上停留。保证点 $1$ 和点 $n$ 之间有一些点有百合花。请输出青蛙到达点 $n$ 的最小跳跃次数。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
输入的第一行包括两个正整数 $n$ 和 $d$ $( 2<=n<=100, 1<=d<=n-1 )$ 。
输入的第二行是一个长度为 $n$ 的无空格字符串，由`0`和`1`组成，表示哪些点上有百合花（`1`表示有）。保证点 $1$ 和点 $n$ 有百合花。
### 输出格式
输出青蛙的最小跳跃次数。如果它不可能到达，输出-1。
## 输入输出样例
略
## 说明
在样例1中，青蛙可以从点 $1$ 跳3个单位到点 $4$ ，再从点 $4$ 跳4个单位到点 $8$ .
在样例2中，青蛙不能到达点 $n$ ，因为它至少需要跳3个单位，但它最多只能跳2个单位。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A frog lives on the axis $ Ox $ and needs to reach home which is in the point $ n $ . She starts from the point $ 1 $ . The frog can jump to the right at a distance not more than $ d $ . So, after she jumped from the point $ x $ she can reach the point $ x+a $ , where $ a $ is an integer from $ 1 $ to $ d $ .
For each point from $ 1 $ to $ n $ is known if there is a lily flower in it. The frog can jump only in points with a lilies. Guaranteed that there are lilies in the points $ 1 $ and $ n $ .
Determine the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach home which is in the point $ n $ from the point $ 1 $ . Consider that initially the frog is in the point $ 1 $ . If the frog can not reach home, print -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ , $ 1<=d<=n-1 $ ) — the point, which the frog wants to reach, and the maximal length of the frog jump.
The second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of zeros and ones. If a character of the string $ s $ equals to zero, then in the corresponding point there is no lily flower. In the other case, in the corresponding point there is a lily flower. Guaranteed that the first and the last characters of the string $ s $ equal to one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the frog can not reach the home, print -1.
In the other case, print the minimal number of jumps that the frog needs to reach the home which is in the point $ n $ from the point $ 1 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the from can reach home in two jumps: the first jump from the point $ 1 $ to the point $ 4 $ (the length of the jump is three), and the second jump from the point $ 4 $ to the point $ 8 $ (the length of the jump is four).
In the second example the frog can not reach home, because to make it she need to jump on a distance three, but the maximum length of her jump equals to two.</div>
