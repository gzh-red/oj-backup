<h1>Berstagram</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp recently signed up to a new social network Berstagram. He immediately published $ n $ posts there. He assigned numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ to all posts and published them one by one. So, just after publishing Polycarp's news feed contained posts from $ 1 $ to $ n $ — the highest post had number $ 1 $ , the next one had number $ 2 $ , ..., the lowest post had number $ n $ .
After that he wrote down all likes from his friends. Likes were coming consecutively from the $ 1 $ -st one till the $ m $ -th one. You are given a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \le a_j \le n $ ), where $ a_j $ is the post that received the $ j $ -th like.
News feed in Berstagram works in the following manner. Let's assume the $ j $ -th like was given to post $ a_j $ . If this post is not the highest (first) one then it changes its position with the one above. If $ a_j $ is the highest post nothing changes.
For example, if $ n=3 $ , $ m=5 $ and $ a=[3,2,1,3,3] $ , then Polycarp's news feed had the following states:
- before the first like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;
- after the first like: $ [1, 3, 2] $ ;
- after the second like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;
- after the third like: $ [1, 2, 3] $ ;
- after the fourth like: $ [1, 3, 2] $ ;
- after the fifth like: $ [3, 1, 2] $ .
Polycarp wants to know the highest (minimum) and the lowest (maximum) positions for each post. Polycarp considers all moments of time, including the moment "before all likes".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le m \le 4 \cdot10^5 $ ) — number of posts and number of likes.
The second line contains integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m $ ( $ 1 \le a_j \le n $ ), where $ a_j $ is the post that received the $ j $ -th like.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ pairs of integer numbers. The $ i $ -th line should contain the highest (minimum) and the lowest (maximum) positions of the $ i $ -th post. You should take into account positions at all moments of time: before all likes, after each like and after all likes. Positions are numbered from $ 1 $ (highest) to $ n $ (lowest).</div>
