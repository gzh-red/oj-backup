<h1>Giga Tower</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数字$a$（$-8888888888\leq{a}\leq{8888888888}$($10$个$8$)，就是输入），求最小的一个**正整数**$b$（就是输出）使得$a+b$为幸运数字。
当且仅当一个数字的各个数位中至少含有一个数字$8$时，定义它是[幸运数字]</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Giga Tower is the tallest and deepest building in Cyberland. There are $ 17777777777 $ floors, numbered from $ -8888888888 $ to $ 8888888888 $ . In particular, there is floor $ 0 $ between floor $ -1 $ and floor $ 1 $ . Every day, thousands of tourists come to this place to enjoy the wonderful view.
In Cyberland, it is believed that the number "8" is a lucky number (that's why Giga Tower has $ 8888888888 $ floors above the ground), and, an integer is lucky, if and only if its decimal notation contains at least one digit "8". For example, $ 8,-180,808 $ are all lucky while $ 42,-10 $ are not. In the Giga Tower, if you write code at a floor with lucky floor number, good luck will always be with you (Well, this round is #278, also lucky, huh?).
Tourist Henry goes to the tower to seek good luck. Now he is at the floor numbered $ a $ . He wants to find the minimum positive integer $ b $ , such that, if he walks $ b $ floors higher, he will arrive at a floor with a lucky number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of input contains an integer $ a $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum $ b $ in a line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>179
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>-1

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>18
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>10
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, he has to arrive at the floor numbered $ 180 $ .
For the second sample, he will arrive at $ 8 $ .
Note that $ b $ should be positive, so the answer for the third sample is $ 10 $ , not $ 0 $ .</div>
