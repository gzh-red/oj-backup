<h1>Weird Rounding</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一行两个数，为n和k(0≤n≤$2*10^{9}$,1≤k≤9)。
输出一个整数，表示将n删去多少个字符后能被$10^{k}$整除。
Note:
一个数不能有前导0，即将100删去一个1是不合法的，需要再删去一个0。
0能被任何$10^{k}$整除。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by $ 10^{k} $ .
In the given number of $ n $ Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by $ 10^{k} $ . For example, if $ k=3 $ , in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by $ 10^{3}=1000 $ .
Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number $ n $ , so that the result is divisible by $ 10^{k} $ . The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).
It is guaranteed that the answer exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=n<=2000000000 $ , $ 1<=k<=9 $ ).
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ w $ — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate $ w $ digits from the number $ n $ , the result should have a value that is divisible by $ 10^{k} $ . The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.</div>
