<h1>Painting The Wall</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个 $n \times n$ 的网格，其中 $m$ 个格子上涂了色。每次随机选择一个格子（有可能是涂过色的格子）涂色，求让网格每一行每一列都至少有一个格子涂了色的操作次数期望。
感谢@litble 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>User ainta decided to paint a wall. The wall consists of $ n^{2} $ tiles, that are arranged in an $ n×n $ table. Some tiles are painted, and the others are not. As he wants to paint it beautifully, he will follow the rules below.
1. Firstly user ainta looks at the wall. If there is at least one painted cell on each row and at least one painted cell on each column, he stops coloring. Otherwise, he goes to step 2.
2. User ainta choose any tile on the wall with uniform probability.
3. If the tile he has chosen is not painted, he paints the tile. Otherwise, he ignores it.
4. Then he takes a rest for one minute even if he doesn't paint the tile. And then ainta goes to step 1.
However ainta is worried if it would take too much time to finish this work. So he wants to calculate the expected time needed to paint the wall by the method above. Help him find the expected time. You can assume that choosing and painting any tile consumes no time at all.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{3} $ ; $ 0<=m<=min(n^{2},2·10^{4}) $ ) — the size of the wall and the number of painted cells.
Next $ m $ lines goes, each contains two integers $ r_{i} $ and $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=r_{i},c_{i}<=n $ ) — the position of the painted cell. It is guaranteed that the positions are all distinct. Consider the rows of the table are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Consider the columns of the table are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the expected time to paint the wall in minutes. Your answer will be considered correct if it has at most $ 10^{-4} $ absolute or relative error.</div>
