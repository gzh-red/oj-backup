<h1>Ternary Logic</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Petya very much likes computers. Recently he has received a new "Ternatron IV" as a gift from his mother. Unlike other modern computers, "Ternatron IV" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the $ xor $ operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).
It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called $ tor $ ) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression $ a\ tor\ b $ . Both numbers $ a $ and $ b $ are written in the ternary notation one under the other one ( $ b $ under $ a $ ). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred). For example: $ 14_{10}\ tor\ 50_{10}=0112_{3}\ tor\ 1212_{3}=1021_{3}=34_{10} $ .
Petya wrote numbers $ a $ and $ c $ on a piece of paper. Help him find such number $ b $ , that $ a\ tor\ b=c $ . If there are several such numbers, print the smallest one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ a $ and $ c $ ( $ 0<=a,c<=10^{9} $ ). Both numbers are written in decimal notation.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single integer $ b $ , such that $ a\ tor\ b=c $ . If there are several possible numbers $ b $ , print the smallest one. You should print the number in decimal notation.</div>
