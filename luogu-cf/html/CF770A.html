<h1>New Password</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小明要修改他的Ugoul密码，要求其密码必须满足以下要求：
1、长度必须是N
2、必须是由小写字母组成
3、共有K种不同的字符
4、任意两个相同字符不可以相连
请你为他构造一个合适的密码，使得密码满足以上条件 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Innokentiy decides to change the password in the social net "Contact!", but he is too lazy to invent a new password by himself. That is why he needs your help.
Innokentiy decides that new password should satisfy the following conditions:
- the length of the password must be equal to $ n $ ,
- the password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters,
- the number of distinct symbols in the password must be equal to $ k $ ,
- any two consecutive symbols in the password must be distinct.
Your task is to help Innokentiy and to invent a new password which will satisfy all given conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ , $ 2<=k<=min(n,26) $ ) — the length of the password and the number of distinct symbols in it.
Pay attention that a desired new password always exists.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print any password which satisfies all conditions given by Innokentiy.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>java
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>python
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>5 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>phphp
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — java, because its length is equal to $ 4 $ and $ 3 $ distinct lowercase letters a, j and v are used in it.
In the second test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — python, because its length is equal to $ 6 $ and it consists of $ 6 $ distinct lowercase letters.
In the third test there is one of the appropriate new passwords — phphp, because its length is equal to $ 5 $ and $ 2 $ distinct lowercase letters p and h are used in it.
Pay attention the condition that no two identical symbols are consecutive is correct for all appropriate passwords in tests.</div>
