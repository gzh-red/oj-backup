<h1>Increasing Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>把数列中一个数加上d算作一次操作
求最少几次操作能把这个数列变为递增数列
Translated by @Playnext</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A sequence $ a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{t-1} $ is called increasing if $ a_{i-1}<a_{i} $ for each $ i:0<i<t $ . You are given a sequence $ b_{0},b_{1},...,b_{n-1} $ and a positive integer $ d $ . In each move you may choose one element of the given sequence and add $ d $ to it. What is the least number of moves required to make the given sequence increasing?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 2<=n<=2000,1<=d<=10^{6} $ ). The second line contains space separated sequence $ b_{0},b_{1},...,b_{n-1} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=10^{6} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the minimal number of moves needed to make the sequence increasing.</div>
