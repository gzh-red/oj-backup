<h1>Rectangle Painting 1</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给 $n\times n$ 矩阵只含 ``.``或``#``，请用价值和最少的一堆长方形覆盖所有的 ``#``，一个长方形的价值是长与宽的最大值
第一行一个整数 $n(1\le n\le 50)$
接下来 $n$ 行每行 $n$ 个字符
Aiming_High 太强了</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a square grid of size $ n \times n $ . Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $ \max(h, w) $ to color a rectangle of size $ h \times w $ . You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 50 $ ) — the size of the square grid.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a string of length $ n $ , consisting of characters '.' and '\#'. The $ j $ -th character of the $ i $ -th line is '\#' if the cell with coordinates $ (i, j) $ is black, otherwise it is white.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum total cost to paint all cells in white.</div>
