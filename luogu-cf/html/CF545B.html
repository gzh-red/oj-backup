<h1>Equidistant String</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Susie loves strings. Today she calculates distances between them. As Susie is a small girl after all, her strings contain only digits zero and one. She uses the definition of Hamming distance:
We will define the distance between two strings $ s $ and $ t $ of the same length consisting of digits zero and one as the number of positions $ i $ , such that $ s_{i} $ isn't equal to $ t_{i} $ .
As besides everything else Susie loves symmetry, she wants to find for two strings $ s $ and $ t $ of length $ n $ such string $ p $ of length $ n $ , that the distance from $ p $ to $ s $ was equal to the distance from $ p $ to $ t $ .
It's time for Susie to go to bed, help her find such string $ p $ or state that it is impossible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains string $ s $ of length $ n $ .
The second line contains string $ t $ of length $ n $ .
The length of string $ n $ is within range from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{5} $ . It is guaranteed that both strings contain only digits zero and one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a string of length $ n $ , consisting of digits zero and one, that meets the problem statement. If no such string exist, print on a single line "impossible" (without the quotes).
If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
