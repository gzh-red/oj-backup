<h1>Playing with Dice</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
两个人正在玩游戏。每人写一个 1~6 之间的数，然后掷骰子。写下的数字和骰子上的数最接近的那个人获胜。如果两个人写的数和骰子上的数差距都是一样的，那么是平局。
第一个人写的数是 a，第二个人写的数是 b。
请分别输出第一个人赢、平局、第二个人赢有多少种可能（方法数）。
## 输入格式
一行两个数 a 和 b (1<=a,b<=6)。
表示两个人写下的数。
## 输出格式
一行三个数，用空格分隔。
分别表示第一个人赢、平局、第二个人赢的方法数。
## 说明
骰子是一个正方体。每个面上有 1~6 的数字。
当 $| a-x | < | b-x |$ 时，可以说 a 比 b 更接近 x。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two players are playing a game. First each of them writes an integer from 1 to 6, and then a dice is thrown. The player whose written number got closer to the number on the dice wins. If both payers have the same difference, it's a draw.
The first player wrote number $ a $ , the second player wrote number $ b $ . How many ways to throw a dice are there, at which the first player wins, or there is a draw, or the second player wins?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=6 $ ) — the numbers written on the paper by the first and second player, correspondingly.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print three integers: the number of ways to throw the dice at which the first player wins, the game ends with a draw or the second player wins, correspondingly.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The dice is a standard cube-shaped six-sided object with each side containing a number from 1 to 6, and where all numbers on all sides are distinct.
You can assume that number $ a $ is closer to number $ x $ than number $ b $ , if $ |a-x|&lt;|b-x| $ .</div>
