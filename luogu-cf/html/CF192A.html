<h1>Funky Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
今年最时髦的数字是三角数（即可表示为![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF192A/b7835ec12be1f62e2540332b68d58fb7ebe6c923.png)的数字，其中k是正整数），而今年最酷的数字是那些可表示为两个三角数之和的数字。
著名的嬉皮士安德烈崇拜一切酷而时髦的东西。但不幸的是，他不擅长数学。给定一个数字n，请帮助他确定这个数字是否能够由两个三角形数的和来表示。（两个三角数可以相同）
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
一行，一个数n(1<=n<=10^9)。
## 输出格式：
输出这个数是否满足安德烈的要求。如果是，输出“YES”，否则输出“NO”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you very well know, this year's funkiest numbers are so called triangular numbers (that is, integers that are representable as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF192A/b7835ec12be1f62e2540332b68d58fb7ebe6c923.png), where $ k $ is some positive integer), and the coolest numbers are those that are representable as a sum of two triangular numbers.
A well-known hipster Andrew adores everything funky and cool but unfortunately, he isn't good at maths. Given number $ n $ , help him define whether this number can be represented by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" (without the quotes), if $ n $ can be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>256
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>512
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample number ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF192A/4cb9109ae81f8a893fe062b72141c5fdcad6da49.png).
In the second sample number $ 512 $ can not be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers.</div>
