<h1>Optimal Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>And here goes another problem on arrays. You are given positive integer $ len $ and array $ a $ which consists of $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ . Let's introduce two characteristics for the given array.
- Let's consider an arbitrary interval of the array with length $ len $ , starting in position $ i $ . Value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF182C/a67922122e1d38581ab8c091ae9897d972811ca1.png), is the modular sum on the chosen interval. In other words, the modular sum is the sum of integers on the chosen interval with length $ len $ , taken in its absolute value.
- Value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF182C/93dd358f9082d67d4f803ced64f412bb80cdf4c2.png) is the optimal sum of the array. In other words, the optimal sum of an array is the maximum of all modular sums on various intervals of array with length $ len $ .
Your task is to calculate the optimal sum of the given array $ a $ . However, before you do the calculations, you are allowed to produce no more than $ k $ consecutive operations of the following form with this array: one operation means taking an arbitrary number from array $ a_{i} $ and multiply it by -1. In other words, no more than $ k $ times you are allowed to take an arbitrary number $ a_{i} $ from the array and replace it with $ -a_{i} $ . Each number of the array is allowed to choose an arbitrary number of times.
Your task is to calculate the maximum possible optimal sum of the array after at most $ k $ operations described above are completed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ len $ ( $ 1<=len<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of elements in the array and the length of the chosen subinterval of the array, correspondingly.
The second line contains a sequence consisting of $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ $ (|a_{i}|<=10^{9}) $ — the original array.
The third line contains a single integer $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=n $ ) — the maximum allowed number of operations.
All numbers in lines are separated by a single space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the maximum possible optimal sum after no more than $ k $ acceptable operations are fulfilled.
Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
