<h1>Guess the Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Iahub and Iahubina went to a picnic in a forest full of trees. Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food.
Iahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that
- each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;
- node $ i $ has $ c_{i} $ nodes in its subtree?
Iahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain $ n $ nodes.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=24 $ ). Next line contains $ n $ positive integers: the $ i $ -th number represents $ c_{i} $ $ (1<=c_{i}<=n) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output on the first line "YES" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output "NO" (without quotes).</div>
