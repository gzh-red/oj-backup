<h1>The Check of the Point【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>On the coordinate plane there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The length of the square side is equal to $ a $ . The lower left corner of the square coincides with the point ( $ 0,0 $ ) (the point of the origin). The upper right corner of the square has positive coordinates.
You are given a point with coordinates ( $ x $ , $ y $ ). Your task is to determine whether this point is located strictly inside the square, on its side, or strictly outside the square.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ a $ , $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=a<=1000 $ , $ -1000<=x,y<=1000 $ ) — the length of the square side and the coordinates of the point which should be checked.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer:
- 0, if the point is located strictly inside the square;
- 1, if the point is located on the side of the square;
- 2, if the point is located strictly outside the square.</div>
