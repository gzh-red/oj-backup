<h1>Coffee Break</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目大意：
给定$n$个数和一个$k$，这$n$个数都不超过$m$
每次从没被去掉的数里面选一个数$a$，去掉$a$，然后可以任意一个$b(b>a+k)$，然后去掉任意一个$c(c>b+k)$，以此类推
问最少能选多少个$a$，然后输出每个数都是选第几个$a$的时候被去掉的
### 输入格式：
一行三个整数$n,m,k$
再一行$n$个整数，表示给定的数
### 输出格式：
第一行一个整数，表示最少选$a$的个数
第二行$n$个整数，表示每个数都是选第几个$a$时被去掉的
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently Monocarp got a job. His working day lasts exactly $ m $ minutes. During work, Monocarp wants to drink coffee at certain moments: there are $ n $ minutes $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ , when he is able and willing to take a coffee break (for the sake of simplicity let's consider that each coffee break lasts exactly one minute).
However, Monocarp's boss doesn't like when Monocarp takes his coffee breaks too often. So for the given coffee break that is going to be on minute $ a_i $ , Monocarp must choose the day in which he will drink coffee during the said minute, so that every day at least $ d $ minutes pass between any two coffee breaks. Monocarp also wants to take these $ n $ coffee breaks in a minimum possible number of working days (he doesn't count days when he is not at work, and he doesn't take coffee breaks on such days). Take into account that more than $ d $ minutes pass between the end of any working day and the start of the following working day.
For each of the $ n $ given minutes determine the day, during which Monocarp should take a coffee break in this minute. You have to minimize the number of days spent.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ d $ $ (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^{5}, n \le m \le 10^{9}, 1 \le d \le m) $ — the number of coffee breaks Monocarp wants to have, the length of each working day, and the minimum number of minutes between any two consecutive coffee breaks.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ $ (1 \le a_i \le m) $ , where $ a_i $ is some minute when Monocarp wants to have a coffee break.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, write the minimum number of days required to make a coffee break in each of the $ n $ given minutes.
In the second line, print $ n $ space separated integers. The $ i $ -th of integers should be the index of the day during which Monocarp should have a coffee break at minute $ a_i $ . Days are numbered from $ 1 $ . If there are multiple optimal solutions, you may print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Monocarp can take two coffee breaks during the first day (during minutes $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ , $ 3 $ minutes will pass between these breaks). One break during the second day (at minute $ 2 $ ), and one break during the third day (at minute $ 3 $ ).
In the second example, Monocarp can determine the day of the break as follows: if the minute when he wants to take a break is odd, then this break is on the first day, if it is even, then this break is on the second day.</div>
