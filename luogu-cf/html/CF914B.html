<h1>Conan and Agasa play a Card Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目简要描述
两人决定玩一种卡牌游戏。Conan有n张卡牌,第i张卡牌上写着一个数字ai.
该游戏从Conan开始。在每一回合中，玩家选择并移动一张卡牌。同时，他要移动所有小于他所选择卡牌上数字的卡牌。
当玩家在他的回合内无法移动卡牌时，他将输掉。
预测游戏的结果，假设双方都是dalao.
输入格式
第一行输入一个整数n ( 1<=n<=10^5)
第二行输入n个整数。a1,a2,…an(1<=ai<=10^5)ai指第i张卡牌上的数。
输出格式
输出赢家的名字(没有引号)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Edogawa Conan got tired of solving cases, and invited his friend, Professor Agasa, over. They decided to play a game of cards. Conan has $ n $ cards, and the $ i $ -th card has a number $ a_{i} $ written on it.
They take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses the $ i $ -th card, he removes that card and removes the $ j $ -th card for all $ j $ such that $ a_{j}<a_{i} $ . A player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of cards Conan has.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the number on the $ i $ -th card.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Conan wins, print "Conan" (without quotes), otherwise print "Agasa" (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
4 5 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Conan
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2
1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Agasa
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Conan can just choose the card having number $ 7 $ on it and hence remove all the cards. After that, there are no cards left on Agasa's turn.
In the second example, no matter which card Conan chooses, there will be one one card left, which Agasa can choose. After that, there are no cards left when it becomes Conan's turn again.</div>
