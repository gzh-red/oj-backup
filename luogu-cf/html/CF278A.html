<h1>Circle Line</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
有$n$个车站排成一个环形，给定$n$个车站之间的距离，求从第$s$个车站到第$t$个车站所需的最短距离。
## 输入格式
第一行给定车站个数$n$。
第二行给定$n$个车站之间的距离，其中第$i$个数表示第$i$个车站到第$i+1$个车站的距离$d_{i}$。特别地，最后一个数表示第一个车站与最后一个车站之间的距离。
第三行给定两个整数$s$和$t$，表示起点和终点。
## 输出格式
输出共一行，表示第$s$个车站到第$t$个车站之间的最短距离。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The circle line of the Berland subway has $ n $ stations. We know the distances between all pairs of neighboring stations:
- $ d_{1} $ is the distance between the $ 1 $ -st and the $ 2 $ -nd station;
- $ d_{2} $ is the distance between the $ 2 $ -nd and the $ 3 $ -rd station;...
- $ d_{n-1} $ is the distance between the $ n-1 $ -th and the $ n $ -th station;
- $ d_{n} $ is the distance between the $ n $ -th and the $ 1 $ -st station.
The trains go along the circle line in both directions. Find the shortest distance between stations with numbers $ s $ and $ t $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of stations on the circle line. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ d_{1},d_{2},...,d_{n} $ ( $ 1<=d_{i}<=100 $ ) — the distances between pairs of neighboring stations. The third line contains two integers $ s $ and $ t $ ( $ 1<=s,t<=n $ ) — the numbers of stations, between which you need to find the shortest distance. These numbers can be the same.
The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the length of the shortest path between stations number $ s $ and $ t $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the length of path $ 1→2→3 $ equals 5, the length of path $ 1→4→3 $ equals 13.
In the second sample the length of path $ 4→1 $ is 100, the length of path $ 4→3→2→1 $ is 15.
In the third sample the length of path $ 3→1 $ is 1, the length of path $ 3→2→1 $ is 2.
In the fourth sample the numbers of stations are the same, so the shortest distance equals 0.</div>
