<h1>Deletion of Repeats</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个字符串。它里面有许多不同的字母，这些字母用数字来标记，而且每个字母最多出现10次。现在要求按一定的规则删除字符串中的重复部分：首先找到最短的重复部分（如果有多个就选择最左边的），然后删掉它的左半部分和左边的全部字母</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Once Bob saw a string. It contained so many different letters, that the letters were marked by numbers, but at the same time each letter could be met in the string at most 10 times. Bob didn't like that string, because it contained repeats: a repeat of length $ x $ is such a substring of length $ 2x $ , that its first half coincides character by character with its second half. Bob started deleting all the repeats from the string. He does it as follows: while it's possible, Bob takes the shortest repeat, if it is not unique, he takes the leftmost one, and deletes its left half and everything that is to the left of this repeat.
You're given the string seen by Bob. Find out, what it will look like after Bob deletes all the repeats in the way described above.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — length of the string. The following line contains $ n $ space-separated integer numbers from $ 0 $ to $ 10^{9} $ inclusive — numbers that stand for the letters of the string. It's guaranteed that each letter can be met in the string at most 10 times.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line output the length of the string's part, left after Bob's deletions. In the second line output all the letters (separated by a space) of the string, left after Bob deleted all the repeats in the described way.</div>
