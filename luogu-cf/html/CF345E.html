<h1>Black Cat Rush</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today you go out of your house and immediately notice that something is weird. Around your door there is a swarm of black cats — all tense paws and twitching tails. As you do your first step, they all dart off and start running towards you. It looks like they want to thwart you!
You are moving in a straight line from point $ (0,0) $ to point $ (a,0) $ with velocity $ v $ . There are $ n $ black cats around you who want to cross your paths. A cat can move in any direction with velocity at most $ u $ . A cat assumes it has crossed your path if it managed to get to at least one point of your path earlier or at the same time as you got there.
You are given four integers: $ a $ , $ v $ , $ u $ , $ n $ , as well as cats' coordinates $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ . What is the greatest number of cats who manage to cross your path?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers $ a $ , $ v $ , $ u $ , $ n $ $ (1<=a<=10000; 1<=v,u<=100; 1<=n<=1000) $ . Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ $ (-100<=x_{i},y_{i}<=100) $ — location of the $ i $ -th cat.
It's guaranteed that all cats are located in distinct points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — what is the greatest number of cats who manage to cross your path?</div>
