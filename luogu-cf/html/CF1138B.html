<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题意：** 有$n$组数（保证$n$是偶数），每组数中有两个数，第$i$组数中的数为$c_i$和$a_i$，其中$c_i,a_i$都为$0$或$1$
您需要将$n$组数分成两部分，满足：
- 每部分$\frac{n}{2}$组数。
- 第一部分中$c_i$的和=第二部分中$a_i$的和。
**数据范围：** $2\le n\le 5000$
**输入格式：** 第一行一个整数$n$，接下来两行每行一个长度为n的01字符串，第一行的串描述$c_i$，第二行的串描述$a_i$
**输出格式：** 无解输出-1。或者输出$\frac{n}{2}$个整数，表示第一部分中的数的编号。
**样例1说明：** $c_1+c_4=1=a_2+a_3$，于是输出1 4.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp is a head of a circus troupe. There are $ n $ — an even number — artists in the troupe. It is known whether the $ i $ -th artist can perform as a clown (if yes, then $ c_i = 1 $ , otherwise $ c_i = 0 $ ), and whether they can perform as an acrobat (if yes, then $ a_i = 1 $ , otherwise $ a_i = 0 $ ).
Split the artists into two performances in such a way that:
- each artist plays in exactly one performance,
- the number of artists in the two performances is equal (i.e. equal to $ \frac{n}{2} $ ),
- the number of artists that can perform as clowns in the first performance is the same as the number of artists that can perform as acrobats in the second performance.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 5\,000 $ , $ n $ is even) — the number of artists in the troupe.
The second line contains $ n $ digits $ c_1 c_2 \ldots c_n $ , the $ i $ -th of which is equal to $ 1 $ if the $ i $ -th artist can perform as a clown, and $ 0 $ otherwise.
The third line contains $ n $ digits $ a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n $ , the $ i $ -th of which is equal to $ 1 $ , if the $ i $ -th artist can perform as an acrobat, and $ 0 $ otherwise.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ \frac{n}{2} $ distinct integers — the indices of the artists that should play in the first performance.
If there are multiple answers, print any.
If there is no solution, print a single integer $ -1 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, one of the possible divisions into two performances is as follows: in the first performance artists $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ should take part. Then the number of artists in the first performance who can perform as clowns is equal to $ 1 $ . And the number of artists in the second performance who can perform as acrobats is $ 1 $ as well.
In the second example, the division is not possible.
In the third example, one of the possible divisions is as follows: in the first performance artists $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ should take part. Then in the first performance there are $ 2 $ artists who can perform as clowns. And the number of artists in the second performance who can perform as acrobats is $ 2 $ as well.</div>
