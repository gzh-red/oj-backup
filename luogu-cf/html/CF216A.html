<h1>Tiling with Hexagons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个由正六边形拼成的不规则六边形的边长$a,b,c$，求该新六边形由多少个正六边形构成的。
例如下图中$a=2,b=3,c=4$，它由$18$个正六边形组成。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Several ages ago Berland was a kingdom. The King of Berland adored math. That's why, when he first visited one of his many palaces, he first of all paid attention to the floor in one hall. The floor was tiled with hexagonal tiles.
The hall also turned out hexagonal in its shape. The King walked along the perimeter of the hall and concluded that each of the six sides has $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ , $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ adjacent tiles, correspondingly.
To better visualize the situation, look at the picture showing a similar hexagon for $ a=2 $ , $ b=3 $ and $ c=4 $ .
