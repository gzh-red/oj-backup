<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You took a peek on Thanos wearing Infinity Gauntlet. In the Gauntlet there is a place for six Infinity Gems:
- the Power Gem of purple color,
- the Time Gem of green color,
- the Space Gem of blue color,
- the Soul Gem of orange color,
- the Reality Gem of red color,
- the Mind Gem of yellow color.
Using colors of Gems you saw in the Gauntlet determine the names of absent Gems.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input there is one integer $ n $ ( $ 0 \le n \le 6 $ ) — the number of Gems in Infinity Gauntlet.
In next $ n $ lines there are colors of Gems you saw. Words used for colors are: purple, green, blue, orange, red, yellow. It is guaranteed that all the colors are distinct. All colors are given in lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line output one integer $ m $ ( $ 0 \le m \le 6 $ ) — the number of absent Gems.
Then in $ m $ lines print the names of absent Gems, each on its own line. Words used for names are: Power, Time, Space, Soul, Reality, Mind. Names can be printed in any order. Keep the first letter uppercase, others lowercase.</div>

In the second sample Thanos doesn't have any Gems, so he needs all six.</div>
