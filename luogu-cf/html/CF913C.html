<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.
Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of $ n $ different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type $ i $ has volume $ 2^{i-1} $ liters and costs $ c_{i} $ roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.
You want to buy at least $ L $ liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ L $ ( $ 1<=n<=30 $ ; $ 1<=L<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the costs of bottles of different types.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least $ L $ liters of lemonade.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.
In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.
In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.</div>
