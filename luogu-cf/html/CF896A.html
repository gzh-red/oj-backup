<h1>Nephren gives a riddle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个无限长的字符串数组，它的第一项f0="What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?"，后面第i项等于"What are you doing while sending ""+第i-1项+""? Are you busy? Will you send ""+第i-1项+""?".给出不超过10个询问，求第n个字符串中的第k个字符是什么。注意引号，问号和空格。如果第n个字符串中没有第k个字符，输出一个'.'。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF896A/71d5e563ad10c30086a6144a53d77f8376f1107c.png)
Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns.
She gives them an infinite array of strings, $ f_{0...\ ∞} $ .
$ f_{0} $ is "What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?".
She wants to let more people know about it, so she defines $ f_{i}= $ "What are you doing while sending " $ f_{i-1} $ "? Are you busy? Will you send " $ f_{i-1} $ "?" for all $ i>=1 $ .
For example, $ f_{1} $ is
"What are you doing while sending "What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?"? Are you busy? Will you send "What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?"?". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of $ f_{1} $ .
It can be seen that the characters in $ f_{i} $ are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces.
Nephren will ask the little leprechauns $ q $ times. Each time she will let them find the $ k $ -th character of $ f_{n} $ . The characters are indexed starting from $ 1 $ . If $ f_{n} $ consists of less than $ k $ characters, output '.' (without quotes).
Can you answer her queries?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10 $ ) — the number of Nephren's questions.
Each of the next $ q $ lines describes Nephren's question and contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{5},1<=k<=10^{18} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>One line containing $ q $ characters. The $ i $ -th character in it should be the answer for the $ i $ -th query.</div>
