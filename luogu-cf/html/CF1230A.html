<h1>Dawid and Bags of Candies</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题意:**
四个袋子里有糖果要分给两个人
一个袋子只能给一个人,可以一人得到多袋,不能自己保留或者打开
如果两个人分得的和相同则输出YES,反之输出NO
**输入格式**
四个整数$1\leq a_i\leq 100$
**输出格式**
YES或NO(大小写任意)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dawid has four bags of candies. The $ i $ -th of them contains $ a_i $ candies. Also, Dawid has two friends. He wants to give each bag to one of his two friends. Is it possible to distribute the bags in such a way that each friend receives the same amount of candies in total?
Note, that you can't keep bags for yourself or throw them away, each bag should be given to one of the friends.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains four integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , $ a_3 $ and $ a_4 $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 $ ) — the numbers of candies in each bag.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output YES if it's possible to give the bags to Dawid's friends so that both friends receive the same amount of candies, or NO otherwise. Each character can be printed in any case (either uppercase or lowercase).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test, Dawid can give the first and the third bag to the first friend, and the second and the fourth bag to the second friend. This way, each friend will receive $ 12 $ candies.
In the second sample test, it's impossible to distribute the bags.</div>
