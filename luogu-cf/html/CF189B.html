<h1>Counting Rhombi</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have two positive integers $ w $ and $ h $ . Your task is to count the number of rhombi which have the following properties:
- Have positive area.
- With vertices at integer points.
- All vertices of the rhombi are located inside or on the border of the rectangle with vertices at points $ (0,0) $ , $ (w,0) $ , $ (w,h) $ , $ (0,h) $ . In other words, for all vertices $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ of the rhombus the following conditions should fulfill: $ 0<=x_{i}<=w $ and $ 0<=y_{i}<=h $ .
- Its diagonals are parallel to the axis.
Count the number of such rhombi.
Let us remind you that a rhombus is a quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ w $ and $ h $ $ (1<=w,h<=4000) $ — the rectangle's sizes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the number of sought rhombi.
Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example there exists only one such rhombus. Its vertices are located at points $ (1,0) $ , $ (2,1) $ , $ (1,2) $ , $ (0,1) $ .</div>
