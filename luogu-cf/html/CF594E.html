<h1>Cutting the Line</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a non-empty line $ s $ and an integer $ k $ . The following operation is performed with this line exactly once:
- A line is split into at most $ k $ non-empty substrings, i.e. string $ s $ is represented as a concatenation of a set of strings $ s=t_{1}+t_{2}+...+t_{m} $ , $ 1<=m<=k $ .
- Some of strings $ t_{i} $ are replaced by strings $ t_{i}^{r} $ , that is, their record from right to left.
- The lines are concatenated back in the same order, we get string $ s'=t'_{1}t'_{2}...\ t'_{m} $ , where $ t'_{i} $ equals $ t_{i} $ or $ t_{i}^{r} $ .
Your task is to determine the lexicographically smallest string that could be the result of applying the given operation to the string $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=5000000 $ ), consisting of lowercase English letters. The second line contains integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=|s| $ ) — the maximum number of parts in the partition.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print the lexicographically minimum string $ s' $ which can be obtained as a result of performing the described operation.</div>
