<h1>Common Divisors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has recently learned at school what a number's divisor is and decided to determine a string's divisor. Here is what he came up with.
String $ a $ is the divisor of string $ b $ if and only if there exists a positive integer $ x $ such that if we write out string $ a $ consecutively $ x $ times, we get string $ b $ . For example, string "abab" has two divisors — "ab" and "abab".
Now Vasya wants to write a program that calculates the number of common divisors of two strings. Please help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains a non-empty string $ s_{1} $ .
The second input line contains a non-empty string $ s_{2} $ .
Lengths of strings $ s_{1} $ and $ s_{2} $ are positive and do not exceed $ 10^{5} $ . The strings only consist of lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of common divisors of strings $ s_{1} $ and $ s_{2} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>abcdabcd
abcdabcdabcdabcd
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>aaa
aa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first sample the common divisors are strings "abcd" and "abcdabcd".
In the second sample the common divisor is a single string "a". String "aa" isn't included in the answer as it isn't a divisor of string "aaa".</div>
