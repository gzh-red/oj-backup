<h1>Phone Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求长度为k，而且大于给定字符串的字符串，要求字典序最小。。。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>And where the are the phone numbers?
You are given a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer $ k $ . Find the lexicographically smallest string $ t $ of length $ k $ , such that its set of letters is a subset of the set of letters of $ s $ and $ s $ is lexicographically smaller than $ t $ .
It's guaranteed that the answer exists.
Note that the set of letters is a set, not a multiset. For example, the set of letters of abadaba is $ {a,b,d} $ .
String $ p $ is lexicographically smaller than string $ q $ , if $ p $ is a prefix of $ q $ , is not equal to $ q $ or there exists $ i $ , such that $ p_{i}<q_{i} $ and for all $ j<i $ it is satisfied that $ p_{j}=q_{j} $ . For example, abc is lexicographically smaller than abcd , abd is lexicographically smaller than abec, afa is not lexicographically smaller than ab and a is not lexicographically smaller than a.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two space separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=100000 $ ) — the length of $ s $ and the required length of $ t $ .
The second line of input contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the string $ t $ conforming to the requirements above.
It's guaranteed that the answer exists.</div>

<h3>输入样例 #4</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the list of strings $ t $ of length 3, such that the set of letters of $ t $ is a subset of letters of $ s $ is as follows: aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, $ ... $ . Among them, those are lexicographically greater than abc: aca, acb, $ ... $ . Out of those the lexicographically smallest is aca.</div>
