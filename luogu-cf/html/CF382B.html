<h1>Number Busters</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Arthur and Alexander are number busters. Today they've got a competition.
Arthur took a group of four integers $ a,b,w,x $ $ (0<=b&lt;w,0&lt;x&lt;w) $ and Alexander took integer $ с $ . Arthur and Alexander use distinct approaches to number bustings. Alexander is just a regular guy. Each second, he subtracts one from his number. In other words, he performs the assignment: $ c=c-1 $ . Arthur is a sophisticated guy. Each second Arthur performs a complex operation, described as follows: if $ b>=x $ , perform the assignment $ b=b-x $ , if $ b&lt;x $ , then perform two consecutive assignments $ a=a-1; b=w-(x-b) $ .
You've got numbers $ a,b,w,x,c $ . Determine when Alexander gets ahead of Arthur if both guys start performing the operations at the same time. Assume that Alexander got ahead of Arthur if $ c<=a $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ a,b,w,x,c $ $ (1<=a<=2·10^{9},1<=w<=1000,0<=b&lt;w,0&lt;x&lt;w,1<=c<=2·10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum time in seconds Alexander needs to get ahead of Arthur. You can prove that the described situation always occurs within the problem's limits.</div>
