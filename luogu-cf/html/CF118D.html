<h1>Caesar&#039;s Legions</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
凯撒大帝喜欢让他的士兵列队。假设他的军队有$n_1$个步兵和$n_2$个骑兵。他认为超过$k_1$个步兵连续排列或是超过$k_2$个骑兵连续排列是不优雅的。请找出共有多少种优雅的列队方案数。
注：所有$n_1+n_2$个士兵都要被排列，且所有步兵和骑兵都视作相同。
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
一行包含四个空格隔开的正整数$n_1,n_2,k_1,k_2(1 \leq n_1, n_2 \leq 100, 1 \leq k_1, k_2 \leq 10)$，分别代表步兵的数量、骑兵的数量、最大的连续步兵数量和最大的连续骑兵数量。
## 输出格式：
输出优雅的列队方案数，结果对$100000000(10^8)$取模
## 说明
1表示步兵，2表示骑兵
第一个样例中，只有一种优雅的排列方式：121
第二个样例中，有五种优雅的排列方式：12122,12212,21212,21221,22121</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Gaius Julius Caesar, a famous general, loved to line up his soldiers. Overall the army had $ n_{1} $ footmen and $ n_{2} $ horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement is not beautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more that $ k_{1} $ footmen standing successively one after another, or there are strictly more than $ k_{2} $ horsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number of beautiful arrangements of the soldiers.
Note that all $ n_{1}+n_{2} $ warriors should be present at each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among themselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among themselves.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains four space-separated integers $ n_{1} $ , $ n_{2} $ , $ k_{1} $ , $ k_{2} $ ( $ 1<=n_{1},n_{2}<=100,1<=k_{1},k_{2}<=10 $ ) which represent how many footmen and horsemen there are and the largest acceptable number of footmen and horsemen standing in succession, correspondingly.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of beautiful arrangements of the army modulo $ 100000000 $ $ (10^{8}) $ . That is, print the number of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more than $ k_{1} $ footmen stand successively, and no more than $ k_{2} $ horsemen stand successively.</div>

<div>Let's mark a footman as 1, and a horseman as 2.
In the first sample the only beautiful line-up is: 121
In the second sample 5 beautiful line-ups exist: 12122, 12212, 21212, 21221, 22121</div>
