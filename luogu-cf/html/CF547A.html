<h1>Mike and Frog</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mike has a frog and a flower. His frog is named Xaniar and his flower is named Abol. Initially(at time $ 0 $ ), height of Xaniar is $ h_{1} $ and height of Abol is $ h_{2} $ . Each second, Mike waters Abol and Xaniar.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547A/50cf6ce14c20a4816bb68e697fff159a14a20ec2.png)So, if height of Xaniar is $ h_{1} $ and height of Abol is $ h_{2} $ , after one second height of Xaniar will become ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547A/400a01ffe03ca079242e93f2c2d5350d22cdc247.png) and height of Abol will become ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547A/58fd7a79d975ec6a56f22d00931ac4933868b860.png) where $ x_{1},y_{1},x_{2} $ and $ y_{2} $ are some integer numbers and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF547A/bdb98ecde46e3f352d01af41e63fb22f595cd2ae.png) denotes the remainder of $ a $ modulo $ b $ .
Mike is a competitive programmer fan. He wants to know the minimum time it takes until height of Xania is $ a_{1} $ and height of Abol is $ a_{2} $ .
Mike has asked you for your help. Calculate the minimum time or say it will never happen.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains integer $ m $ ( $ 2<=m<=10^{6} $ ).
The second line of input contains integers $ h_{1} $ and $ a_{1} $ ( $ 0<=h_{1},a_{1}&lt;m $ ).
The third line of input contains integers $ x_{1} $ and $ y_{1} $ ( $ 0<=x_{1},y_{1}&lt;m $ ).
The fourth line of input contains integers $ h_{2} $ and $ a_{2} $ ( $ 0<=h_{2},a_{2}&lt;m $ ).
The fifth line of input contains integers $ x_{2} $ and $ y_{2} $ ( $ 0<=x_{2},y_{2}&lt;m $ ).
It is guaranteed that $ h_{1}≠a_{1} $ and $ h_{2}≠a_{2} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of seconds until Xaniar reaches height $ a_{1} $ and Abol reaches height $ a_{2} $ or print -1 otherwise.</div>
