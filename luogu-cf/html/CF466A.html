<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Ann需要搭n次地铁。她有两种票可供选择：第一种票a卢布一张，可以搭一次地铁；第二种票b卢布一张，可以搭m次地铁。问：Ann最少需要多少卢布才能搭n次地铁？
输入：一行四个整数：n,m,a,b。
输出：一行一个整数：Ann搭n次地铁最少需要的钱数（以卢布为单位）
输入输出样例1解释：买六张第一种票或买三张第二种票，等等（译者注：都需要6卢布）。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway ticket costs $ a $ rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special ticket for $ m $ rides (she can buy it several times). It costs $ b $ rubles. Ann did the math; she will need to use subway $ n $ times. Help Ann, tell her what is the minimum sum of money she will have to spend to make $ n $ rides?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ a $ , $ b $ ( $ 1<=n,m,a,b<=1000 $ ) — the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the $ m $ ride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an $ m $ ride ticket.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need to spend.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6 2 1 2
