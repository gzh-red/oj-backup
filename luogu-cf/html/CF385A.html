如果结果小于$0$的话就输出$0$。
### 输入格式
第一行输入$n$和$c$。
接下来一行$n$个数字，描述整个序列。
### 输出格式
输出一行表示结果。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The bear decided to store some raspberry for the winter. He cunningly found out the price for a barrel of honey in kilos of raspberry for each of the following $ n $ days. According to the bear's data, on the $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=n) $ day, the price for one barrel of honey is going to is $ x_{i} $ kilos of raspberry.
Unfortunately, the bear has neither a honey barrel, nor the raspberry. At the same time, the bear's got a friend who is ready to lend him a barrel of honey for exactly one day for $ c $ kilograms of raspberry. That's why the bear came up with a smart plan. He wants to choose some day $ d $ $ (1<=d&lt;n) $ , lent a barrel of honey and immediately (on day $ d $ ) sell it according to a daily exchange rate. The next day $ (d+1) $ the bear wants to buy a new barrel of honey according to a daily exchange rate (as he's got some raspberry left from selling the previous barrel) and immediately (on day $ d+1 $ ) give his friend the borrowed barrel of honey as well as $ c $ kilograms of raspberry for renting the barrel.
The bear wants to execute his plan at most once and then hibernate. What maximum number of kilograms of raspberry can he earn? Note that if at some point of the plan the bear runs out of the raspberry, then he won't execute such a plan.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers, $ n $ and $ c $ $ (2<=n<=100,0<=c<=100) $ , — the number of days and the number of kilos of raspberry that the bear should give for borrowing the barrel.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ $ (0<=x_{i}<=100) $ , the price of a honey barrel on day $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the bear will lend a honey barrel at day 3 and then sell it for 7. Then the bear will buy a barrel for 3 and return it to the friend. So, the profit is (7 - 3 - 1) = 3.
In the second sample bear will lend a honey barrel at day 1 and then sell it for 100. Then the bear buy the barrel for 1 at the day 2. So, the profit is (100 - 1 - 2) = 97.</div>
