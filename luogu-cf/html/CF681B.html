<h1>Economy Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个正整数n(1<n<1e9),判断是否存在自然数a,b,c满足a×1234567+b×123456+c×1234=n.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to $ 0 $ .
Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to $ n $ and that he have bought only some houses (for $ 1234567 $ game-coins each), cars (for $ 123456 $ game-coins each) and computers (for $ 1234 $ game-coins each).
Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial $ n $ game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ such that $ a×1234567+b×123456+c×1234=n $ ?
Please help Kolya answer this question.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9} $ ) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial $ n $ coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1359257
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>17851817
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending $ 1234567+123456+1234=1359257 $ game-coins in total.</div>
