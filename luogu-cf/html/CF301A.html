<h1>Yaroslav and Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Yaroslav has an array, consisting of $ (2·n-1) $ integers. In a single operation Yaroslav can change the sign of exactly $ n $ elements in the array. In other words, in one operation Yaroslav can select exactly $ n $ array elements, and multiply each of them by -1.
Yaroslav is now wondering: what maximum sum of array elements can be obtained if it is allowed to perform any number of described operations?
Help Yaroslav.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ $ (2<=n<=100) $ . The second line contains $ (2·n-1) $ integers — the array elements. The array elements do not exceed $ 1000 $ in their absolute value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum sum that Yaroslav can get.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>100
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample you do not need to change anything. The sum of elements equals $ 150 $ .
In the second sample you need to change the sign of the first two elements. Then we get the sum of the elements equal to $ 100 $ .</div>
