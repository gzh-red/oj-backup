<h1>New Year&#039;s Eve</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：给定两个整数$n$ ,$k$ ,在$1$ ~$n$ 中选择至多$k$ 个整数，使得其异或和最大。求解这个最大值。
感谢@char32_t 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Since Grisha behaved well last year, at New Year's Eve he was visited by Ded Moroz who brought an enormous bag of gifts with him! The bag contains $ n $ sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness.
The choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones — but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!
A xor-sum of a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m} $ is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912B/475d3a054d8c211f23a68d652dd85385e5ab9fc9.png), here ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912B/4298d47c0191af3c0a3103f431751061bc7e2362.png) denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)
Ded Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than $ k $ candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The sole string contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=10^{18} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one number — the largest possible xor-sum.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>7
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>7
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, one optimal answer is $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ , giving the xor-sum of $ 7 $ .
In the second sample case, one can, for example, take all six candies and obtain the xor-sum of $ 7 $ .</div>
