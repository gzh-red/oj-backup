<h1>Weird journey</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>总共有n个节点，m条路径，要求其中m-2条路径走两遍，剩下2条路径仅走一遍，问不同的路径总数有多少，如果仅走一遍的两条边不同则将这两条路径视为不同。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little boy Igor wants to become a traveller. At first, he decided to visit all the cities of his motherland — Uzhlyandia.
It is widely known that Uzhlyandia has $ n $ cities connected with $ m $ bidirectional roads. Also, there are no two roads in the country that connect the same pair of cities, but roads starting and ending in the same city can exist. Igor wants to plan his journey beforehand. Boy thinks a path is good if the path goes over $ m-2 $ roads twice, and over the other $ 2 $ exactly once. The good path can start and finish in any city of Uzhlyandia.
Now he wants to know how many different good paths are in Uzhlyandia. Two paths are considered different if the sets of roads the paths goes over exactly once differ. Help Igor — calculate the number of good paths.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{6}) $ — the number of cities and roads in Uzhlyandia, respectively.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ ) that mean that there is road between cities $ u $ and $ v $ .
It is guaranteed that no road will be given in the input twice. That also means that for every city there is no more than one road that connects the city to itself.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print out the only integer — the number of good paths in Uzhlyandia.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first sample test case the good paths are:
- $ 2→1→3→1→4→1→5 $ ,
- $ 2→1→3→1→5→1→4 $ ,
- $ 2→1→4→1→5→1→3 $ ,
- $ 3→1→2→1→4→1→5 $ ,
- $ 3→1→2→1→5→1→4 $ ,
- $ 4→1→2→1→3→1→5 $ .
There are good paths that are same with displayed above, because the sets of roads they pass over once are same:
- $ 2→1→4→1→3→1→5 $ ,
- $ 2→1→5→1→3→1→4 $ ,
- $ 2→1→5→1→4→1→3 $ ,
- $ 3→1→4→1→2→1→5 $ ,
- $ 3→1→5→1→2→1→4 $ ,
- $ 4→1→3→1→2→1→5 $ ,
- and all the paths in the other direction.
Thus, the answer is $ 6 $ .
In the second test case, Igor simply can not walk by all the roads.
In the third case, Igor walks once over every road.</div>
