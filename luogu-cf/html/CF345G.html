<h1>Suffix Subgroup</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a group of $ n $ strings: $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ .
You should find a subgroup $ s_{i1},s_{i2},...,s_{ik} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{k}<=n) $ of the group. The following two conditions must hold:
- there exists a string $ t $ such, that each string from found subgroup is its suffix;
- the number of strings in the found subgroup is as large as possible.
Your task is to print the number of strings in the found subgroup.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of strings in the group. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a string. The $ i $ -th line contains non-empty string $ s_{i} $ .
Each string consists only from lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all strings $ s_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the number of strings in the found subgroup.</div>
