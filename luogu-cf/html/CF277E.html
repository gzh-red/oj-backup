<h1>Binary Tree on Plane</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你平面上 $n$ 个点 ($2 \leq n \leq 400$)，要求用这些点组成一个二叉树(每个节点的儿子节点不超过两个)，定义每条边的权值为两个点之间的欧几里得距离。求一个权值和最小的二叉树，并输出这个权值。
其中，点 $i$ 可以成为点 $j$ 的的父亲的条件是：点 $i$ 的 $y$ 坐标比 $j$ 的 $y$ 坐标大。
如果不存在满足条件的二叉树，输出 $-1$ 。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A root tree is a directed acyclic graph that contains one node (root), from which there is exactly one path to any other node.
A root tree is binary if each node has at most two outgoing arcs.
When a binary tree is painted on the plane, all arcs should be directed from top to bottom. That is, each arc going from $ u $ to $ v $ must meet the condition $ y_{u}&gt;y_{v} $ .
You've been given the coordinates of all tree nodes. Your task is to connect these nodes by arcs so as to get the binary root tree and make the total length of the arcs minimum. All arcs of the built tree must be directed from top to bottom.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=400 $ ) — the number of nodes in the tree. Then follow $ n $ lines, two integers per line: $ x_{i},y_{i} $ ( $ |x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{3} $ ) — coordinates of the nodes. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to build a binary root tree on the given points, print "-1". Otherwise, print a single real number — the total length of the arcs in the minimum binary tree. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
