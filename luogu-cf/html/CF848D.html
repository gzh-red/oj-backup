<h1>Shake It!</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A never-ending, fast-changing and dream-like world unfolds, as the secret door opens.
A world is an unordered graph $ G $ , in whose vertex set $ V(G) $ there are two special vertices $ s(G) $ and $ t(G) $ . An initial world has vertex set $ {s(G),t(G)} $ and an edge between them.
A total of $ n $ changes took place in an initial world. In each change, a new vertex $ w $ is added into $ V(G) $ , an existing edge $ (u,v) $ is chosen, and two edges $ (u,w) $ and $ (v,w) $ are added into $ E(G) $ . Note that it's possible that some edges are chosen in more than one change.
It's known that the capacity of the minimum $ s $ - $ t $ cut of the resulting graph is $ m $ , that is, at least $ m $ edges need to be removed in order to make $ s(G) $ and $ t(G) $ disconnected.
Count the number of non-similar worlds that can be built under the constraints, modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . We define two worlds similar, if they are isomorphic and there is isomorphism in which the $ s $ and $ t $ vertices are not relabelled. Formally, two worlds $ G $ and $ H $ are considered similar, if there is a bijection between their vertex sets ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF848D/74c8e824289748b1c6091efe47efb3bcb1171b41.png), such that:
- $ f(s(G))=s(H) $ ;
- $ f(t(G))=t(H) $ ;
- Two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ of $ G $ are adjacent in $ G $ if and only if $ f(u) $ and $ f(v) $ are adjacent in $ H $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the following $ 6 $ worlds are pairwise non-similar and satisfy the constraints, with $ s(G) $ marked in green, $ t(G) $ marked in blue, and one of their minimum cuts in light blue.
