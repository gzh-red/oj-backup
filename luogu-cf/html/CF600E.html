<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一棵树有n个结点，每个结点都是一种颜色，每个颜色有一个编号，求树中每个子树的最多的颜色编号的和。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rooted tree with root in vertex $ 1 $ . Each vertex is coloured in some colour.
Let's call colour $ c $ dominating in the subtree of vertex $ v $ if there are no other colours that appear in the subtree of vertex $ v $ more times than colour $ c $ . So it's possible that two or more colours will be dominating in the subtree of some vertex.
The subtree of vertex $ v $ is the vertex $ v $ and all other vertices that contains vertex $ v $ in each path to the root.
For each vertex $ v $ find the sum of all dominating colours in the subtree of vertex $ v $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=n $ ), $ c_{i} $ — the colour of the $ i $ -th vertex.
Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integers $ x_{j},y_{j} $ ( $ 1<=x_{j},y_{j}<=n $ ) — the edge of the tree. The first vertex is the root of the tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers — the sums of dominating colours for each vertex.</div>
