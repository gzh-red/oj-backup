<h1>Perpetual Subtraction</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>初始时，黑板上有一个正整数$n$,初始为$i$的概率是$p_i$.每一轮执行以下操作:
1. 从$[0,n]$内随机选取一个正整数$p$
2. 把$n$擦掉，替换成$p$
给定$M$, 对每个$i\in [1,n]$求$M$轮之后这个数为$i$的概率。
$i\le n\le 10^5, 1\le M\le 10^{18}$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a number $ x $ initially written on a blackboard. You repeat the following action a fixed amount of times:
1. take the number $ x $ currently written on a blackboard and erase it
2. select an integer uniformly at random from the range $ [0,x] $ inclusive, and write it on the blackboard
Determine the distribution of final number given the distribution of initial number and the number of steps.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers, $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=10^{5} $ ) — the maximum number written on the blackboard — and $ M $ ( $ 0<=M<=10^{18} $ ) — the number of steps to perform.
The second line contains $ N+1 $ integers $ P_{0},P_{1},...,P_{N} $ ( $ 0<=P_{i}&lt;998244353 $ ), where $ P_{i} $ describes the probability that the starting number is $ i $ . We can express this probability as irreducible fraction $ P/Q $ , then ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF923E/78b3a8654b742b81f434340c46c8ad67c1db13e6.png). It is guaranteed that the sum of all $ P_{i} $ s equals $ 1 $ (modulo $ 998244353 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single line of $ N+1 $ integers, where $ R_{i} $ is the probability that the final number after $ M $ steps is $ i $ . It can be proven that the probability may always be expressed as an irreducible fraction $ P/Q $ . You are asked to output ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF923E/95a42f726095d243076c95d92a6f5a7c8a8abc93.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case, we start with number 2. After one step, it will be 0, 1 or 2 with probability 1/3 each.
In the second case, the number will remain 2 with probability 1/9. With probability 1/9 it stays 2 in the first round and changes to 1 in the next, and with probability 1/6 changes to 1 in the first round and stays in the second. In all other cases the final integer is 0.</div>
