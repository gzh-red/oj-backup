<h1>Lucky Sorting</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>幸运数字总是由4或者7组成数位。例如，74，744，4是幸运数字，5，17，467则不是。
按升序排列一个长度为n的数列，
两个数字中至少有幸运一个数字时才可以交换。找出排序后可能排出的数列（数列长度不会超过2n）。
# **输入输出格式**
**输入格式：**
第一行是数列长度n（1<=n<=10^5)。第二行是数列中的n个整数，每个数字不超过10^9。
**输出格式：**
第一行输出交换数字的次数k(0<=k<=2n)。在接下来的k行中输出被交换的数字的位置（从1开始算起）。如果没有可交换的数字，输出-1。
如果有不止一种排序方法，输出所有排序方法。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya got an array consisting of $ n $ numbers, it is the gift for his birthday. Now he wants to sort it in the non-decreasing order. However, a usual sorting is boring to perform, that's why Petya invented the following limitation: one can swap any two numbers but only if at least one of them is lucky. Your task is to sort the array according to the specified limitation. Find any possible sequence of the swaps (the number of operations in the sequence should not exceed $ 2n $ ).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains $ n $ positive integers, not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ — the array that needs to be sorted in the non-decreasing order.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line print number $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=2n $ ) — the number of the swaps in the sorting. On the following $ k $ lines print one pair of distinct numbers (a pair per line) — the indexes of elements to swap. The numbers in the array are numbered starting from 1. If it is impossible to sort the given sequence, print the single number -1.
If there are several solutions, output any. Note that you don't have to minimize $ k $ . Any sorting with no more than $ 2n $ swaps is accepted.</div>
