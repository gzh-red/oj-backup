<h1>Name the album</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>雅利欧为他的专辑选择一个新的名字，选择一个新的名字，一个没有使用过或至少最近没有使用过的名字。
如果他找到一个以前没有用过的合适的名字，他会用的。否则他会用很久以前用过的名字。如果发现两个这样的名字（没有使用过或在同一年使用过），他使用的名字是字母顺序最新的。 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The famous singer, Aryo, is going to publish a new album of his great work!
Unfortunately these days, there are many albums, Aryo wants to choose a new name for his album, a name that has not been used or at least has not been used recently.
He has a list of all used album names together with the year the albums were published. He also has a list of suitable names for his album.
If he finds a suitable name which has not been used before, he'll use it. Otherwise he will use the name which was used as long ago as possible. If two such names are found (that haven't been used or were used at the same year), he uses the name that is alphabetically latest.
Help him name his album.</div>
