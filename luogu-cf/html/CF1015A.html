<h1>Points in Segments</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
有n条线段在数轴Ox上，每条线段有介于1到m之间的整数端点。线段之间可以重合、覆盖甚至相同。每条线段由两个整数li和ri描述（1<=li<=ri<=m）--对应左、右端点。
考虑1到m之间的所有整数点。要求你输出所有的不属于任何线段的点。
当且仅当点l<=x<=r时，点x属于这条线段。
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
第一行包括两个整数n，m（1<=n,m<=100）--线段数量和数轴最大值。
下面n行每行包括两个整数li和ri--第i条线段的端点。
注：li可能==ri，即一个线段可能退化成一个点
## 输出格式
第一行输出一个整数 k--不属于任何线段的点的数量。
第二行以任意顺序输出k个整数--不属于任何线段的点数。
如果根本没有这样的点，第一行输出一个整数0并留空第二行或者根本不输出第二行。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a set of $ n $ segments on the axis $ Ox $ , each segment has integer endpoints between $ 1 $ and $ m $ inclusive. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Each segment is characterized by two integers $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le m $ ) — coordinates of the left and of the right endpoints.
Consider all integer points between $ 1 $ and $ m $ inclusive. Your task is to print all such points that don't belong to any segment. The point $ x $ belongs to the segment $ [l; r] $ if and only if $ l \le x \le r $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 100 $ ) — the number of segments and the upper bound for coordinates.
The next $ n $ lines contain two integers each $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le m $ ) — the endpoints of the $ i $ -th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. Note, it is possible that $ l_i=r_i $ , i.e. a segment can degenerate to a point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print one integer $ k $ — the number of points that don't belong to any segment.
In the second line print exactly $ k $ integers in any order — the points that don't belong to any segment. All points you print should be distinct.
If there are no such points at all, print a single integer $ 0 $ in the first line and either leave the second line empty or do not print it at all.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the point $ 1 $ belongs to the second segment, the point $ 2 $ belongs to the first and the second segments and the point $ 5 $ belongs to the third segment. The points $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ do not belong to any segment.
In the second example all the points from $ 1 $ to $ 7 $ belong to the first segment.</div>
