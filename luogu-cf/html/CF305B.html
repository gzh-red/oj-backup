<h1>Continued Fractions</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$p,q,a_1,a_2,...,a_n,$若$\frac{p}{q}=a_1+\frac{1}{a_2+\frac{1}{...+\frac{1}{a_n}}}$则输出"YES",否则输出"NO".(不包含引号)
$n<=90,1<=q<=p<=10^{18},1<=a_i<=10^{18}.$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A continued fraction of height $ n $ is a fraction of form ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305B/19ade84928d3d628a6e212b03adbbf8bc0856736.png). You are given two rational numbers, one is represented as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305B/ae456f9650d5b3ca46e54c303d07fec088f6ad5e.png) and the other one is represented as a finite fraction of height $ n $ . Check if they are equal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ p,q $ $ (1<=q<=p<=10^{18}) $ — the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction.
The second line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=90) $ — the height of the second fraction. The third line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{18}) $ — the continued fraction.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" if these fractions are equal and "NO" otherwise.</div>
