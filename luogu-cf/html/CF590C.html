<h1>Three States</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个?×?的地图，’.’为荒地，’#’为石头，数字为国家，求最少将多少个荒地修为路可以将三个国家联通。无解输出‘-1’。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The famous global economic crisis is approaching rapidly, so the states of Berman, Berance and Bertaly formed an alliance and allowed the residents of all member states to freely pass through the territory of any of them. In addition, it was decided that a road between the states should be built to guarantee so that one could any point of any country can be reached from any point of any other State.
Since roads are always expensive, the governments of the states of the newly formed alliance asked you to help them assess the costs. To do this, you have been issued a map that can be represented as a rectangle table consisting of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. Any cell of the map either belongs to one of three states, or is an area where it is allowed to build a road, or is an area where the construction of the road is not allowed. A cell is called passable, if it belongs to one of the states, or the road was built in this cell. From any passable cells you can move up, down, right and left, if the cell that corresponds to the movement exists and is passable.
Your task is to construct a road inside a minimum number of cells, so that it would be possible to get from any cell of any state to any cell of any other state using only passable cells.
It is guaranteed that initially it is possible to reach any cell of any state from any cell of this state, moving only along its cells. It is also guaranteed that for any state there is at least one cell that belongs to it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains the dimensions of the map $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1000 $ ) — the number of rows and columns respectively.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contain $ m $ characters, describing the rows of the map. Digits from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ represent the accessory to the corresponding state. The character '.' corresponds to the cell where it is allowed to build a road and the character '\#' means no construction is allowed in this cell.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum number of cells you need to build a road inside in order to connect all the cells of all states. If such a goal is unachievable, print -1.</div>
