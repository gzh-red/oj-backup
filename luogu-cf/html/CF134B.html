<h1>Pairs of Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目背景</h2>
<div>重题请做P2090</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's assume that we have a pair of numbers ( $ a,b $ ). We can get a new pair ( $ a+b,b $ ) or ( $ a,a+b $ ) from the given pair in a single step.
Let the initial pair of numbers be (1,1). Your task is to find number $ k $ , that is, the least number of steps needed to transform (1,1) into the pair where at least one number equals $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains the only integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only integer $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The pair (1,1) can be transformed into a pair containing 5 in three moves: (1,1) $ → $ (1,2) $ → $ (3,2) $ → $ (5,2).</div>
