<h1>Prairie Partition</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It can be shown that any positive integer $ x $ can be uniquely represented as $ x=1+2+4+...+2^{k-1}+r $ , where $ k $ and $ r $ are integers, $ k>=0 $ , $ 0&lt;r<=2^{k} $ . Let's call that representation prairie partition of $ x $ .
For example, the prairie partitions of $ 12 $ , $ 17 $ , $ 7 $ and $ 1 $ are:
$ 12=1+2+4+5 $ , $ 17=1+2+4+8+2 $ ,
$ 7=1+2+4 $ ,
$ 1=1 $ .
Alice took a sequence of positive integers (possibly with repeating elements), replaced every element with the sequence of summands in its prairie partition, arranged the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order and gave them to Borys. Now Borys wonders how many elements Alice's original sequence could contain. Find all possible options!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of numbers given from Alice to Borys.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{12} $ ; $ a_{1}<=a_{2}<=...<=a_{n} $ ) — the numbers given from Alice to Borys.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output, in increasing order, all possible values of $ m $ such that there exists a sequence of positive integers of length $ m $ such that if you replace every element with the summands in its prairie partition and arrange the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order, you will get the sequence given in the input.
If there are no such values of $ m $ , output a single integer -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Alice could get the input sequence from $ [6,20] $ as the original sequence.
In the second example, Alice's original sequence could be either $ [4,5] $ or $ [3,3,3] $ .</div>
