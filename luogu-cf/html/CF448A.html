<h1>Rewards</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bizon the Champion is called the Champion for a reason.
Bizon the Champion has recently got a present — a new glass cupboard with $ n $ shelves and he decided to put all his presents there. All the presents can be divided into two types: medals and cups. Bizon the Champion has $ a_{1} $ first prize cups, $ a_{2} $ second prize cups and $ a_{3} $ third prize cups. Besides, he has $ b_{1} $ first prize medals, $ b_{2} $ second prize medals and $ b_{3} $ third prize medals.
Naturally, the rewards in the cupboard must look good, that's why Bizon the Champion decided to follow the rules:
- any shelf cannot contain both cups and medals at the same time;
- no shelf can contain more than five cups;
- no shelf can have more than ten medals.
Help Bizon the Champion find out if we can put all the rewards so that all the conditions are fulfilled.</div>
