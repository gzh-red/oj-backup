<h1>Olympic Medal</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The World Programming Olympics Medal is a metal disk, consisting of two parts: the first part is a ring with outer radius of $ r_{1} $ cm, inner radius of $ r_{2} $ cm, $ (0&lt;r2&lt;r1) $ made of metal with density $ p_{1} $ g/cm $ ^{3} $ . The second part is an inner disk with radius $ r_{2} $ cm, it is made of metal with density $ p_{2} $ g/cm $ ^{3} $ . The disk is nested inside the ring.
The Olympic jury decided that $ r_{1} $ will take one of possible values of $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ . It is up to jury to decide which particular value $ r_{1} $ will take. Similarly, the Olympic jury decided that $ p_{1} $ will take one of possible value of $ y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m} $ , and $ p_{2} $ will take a value from list $ z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{k} $ .
According to most ancient traditions the ratio between the outer ring mass $ m_{out} $ and the inner disk mass $ m_{in} $ must equal ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF215B/cd92991466e894ef37b65a9188f245d17d24ea1f.png), where $ A,B $ are constants taken from ancient books. Now, to start making medals, the jury needs to take values for $ r_{1} $ , $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ and calculate the suitable value of $ r_{2} $ .
The jury wants to choose the value that would maximize radius $ r_{2} $ . Help the jury find the sought value of $ r_{2} $ . Value $ r_{2} $ doesn't have to be an integer.
Medal has a uniform thickness throughout the area, the thickness of the inner disk is the same as the thickness of the outer ring.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains an integer $ n $ and a sequence of integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ . The second input line contains an integer $ m $ and a sequence of integers $ y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m} $ . The third input line contains an integer $ k $ and a sequence of integers $ z_{1},z_{2},...,z_{k} $ . The last line contains two integers $ A $ and $ B $ .
