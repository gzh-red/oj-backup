<h1>Superstitions Inspection</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You read scientific research regarding popularity of most famous superstitions across various countries, and you want to analyze their data. More specifically, you want to know which superstitions are popular in most countries.
The data is given as a single file in the following format: country name on a separate line, followed by a list of superstitions popular in it, one entry per line. Each entry of the list is formatted as an asterisk "\*" followed by a single space and then by the superstition name. Entries are unique within each country. The first line of input will represent a country. The input will contain at least one superstition.
Country name is a non-empty sequence of words, where each word consists of only English letters. The words of the name of some country will be separated in input with one or more spaces.
Superstition name is a non-empty sequence of words, where each word consists of only English letters and digits. The words of the name of some superstition will be separated in input with one or more spaces.
You can consider two names equal, if corresponding sequences of words are equal. You shouldn't consider the case of the letters when you compare the words.
Output the list of superstitions which are observed in the greatest number of countries. It's guaranteed that all countries have distinct names.</div>
