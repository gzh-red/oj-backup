<h1>April Fools&#039; Problem (easy)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
给出一串序列，求序列升序排序后前k个数的和。
# 输入格式
两行
第一行，两个数n,k(1<=k<=n<=2200)。
第二行，一串数列，数列中的每个数都不超过10000。
# 输出格式
一行，一个整数，表示序列升序排序后前k个数的和。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC $ ^{2} $ – this one. It involves numbers $ n $ , $ k $ and a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.
However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=2200 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{4} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one number.</div>
