<h1>Stepan&#039;s Series</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述**
Stepan看了很长时间的电视剧，就这样结束了。总共有n集。
对于每一集，Stepan都记得，要么他肯定看过，要么他肯定没看过，要么他不确定，他有没有看过这一集。
Stepan的不满值是Stepan没有看的连续系列的最大数量。
你的任务是根据Stepan的记忆判断他的不满是否等于k
**输入格式**
第一行包含两个整数n 和 k (0≤n≤100 0≤k≤n) -即电视剧集的数量和应该检查的不满。
第二行包含由n个符号“Y”、“n”和“?”组成的序列。
如果第i个符号等于“Y”，Stepan记得他看过。
如果第i个符号等于“N”，Stepan记得他没有看过。
如果第i个符号号等于"?"， Stepan不太记得他有没有看过。
**输出格式**
如果Stepan的不满正好等于k，那么打印“YES”
否则打印“NO”
输出没有引号
** 说明 **
在第一次测试中，Stepan记得所有的情节，不管他有没有看过。他的不满是2，因为他没有连续看两集——3集和4集。答案是肯定的，因为k =2。
在第二个测试中k = 1,Stepan不满是大于或等于2(因为他记得,至少他还没有看两集连续5集和6集),即使他已经观看了从第1集到第4集(包括第1集和第4集)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had $ n $ episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not.
Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.
Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 0<=k<=n $ ) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked.
The second line contains the sequence which consists of $ n $ symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the $ i $ -th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number $ i $ . If the $ i $ -th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number $ i $ . If the $ i $ -th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number $ i $ or not.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to $ k $ , then print "YES" (without qoutes). Otherwise print "NO" (without qoutes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 2

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is $ 2 $ , because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number $ 3 $ and the episode number $ 4 $ . The answer is "YES", because $ k=2 $ .
In the second test $ k=1 $ , Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to $ 2 $ (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number $ 5 $ and number $ 6 $ ), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.</div>
