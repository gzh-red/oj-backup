<h1>Aztec Catacombs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Indiana Jones found ancient Aztec catacombs containing a golden idol. The catacombs consists of $ n $ caves. Each pair of caves is connected with a two-way corridor that can be opened or closed. The entrance to the catacombs is in the cave $ 1 $ , the idol and the exit are in the cave $ n $ .
When Indiana goes from a cave $ x $ to a cave $ y $ using an open corridor, all corridors connected to the cave $ x $ change their state: all open corridors become closed, all closed corridors become open. Indiana wants to go from cave $ 1 $ to cave $ n $ going through as small number of corridors as possible. Help him find the optimal path, or determine that it is impossible to get out of catacombs.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 0 \leq m \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of caves and the number of open corridors at the initial moment.
The next $ m $ lines describe the open corridors. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n $ , $ u_i \neq v_i $ ) — the caves connected by the $ i $ -th open corridor. It is guaranteed that each unordered pair of caves is presented at most once.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is a path to exit, in the first line print a single integer $ k $ — the minimum number of corridors Indians should pass through ( $ 1 \leq k \leq 10^6 $ ). In the second line print $ k+1 $ integers $ x_0, \ldots, x_k $ — the number of caves in the order Indiana should visit them. The sequence $ x_0, \ldots, x_k $ should satisfy the following:
- $ x_0 = 1 $ , $ x_k = n $ ;
- for each $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k $ the corridor from $ x_{i - 1} $ to $ x_i $ should be open at the moment Indiana walks along this corridor.
If there is no path, print a single integer $ -1 $ .
We can show that if there is a path, there is a path consisting of no more than $ 10^6 $ corridors.</div>
