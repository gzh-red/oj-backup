<h1>LCM Challenge</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>找到3个不超过n的正整数（可以相同），使得它们的lcm（最小公倍数）最大。输出最大的lcm</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Some days ago, I learned the concept of LCM (least common multiple). I've played with it for several times and I want to make a big number with it.
But I also don't want to use many numbers, so I'll choose three positive integers (they don't have to be distinct) which are not greater than $ n $ . Can you help me to find the maximum possible least common multiple of these three integers?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ) — the $ n $ mentioned in the statement.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater than $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>9
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>504
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>210
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The least common multiple of some positive integers is the least positive integer which is multiple for each of them.
The result may become very large, 32-bit integer won't be enough. So using 64-bit integers is recommended.
For the last example, we can chose numbers $ 7 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 5 $ and the LCM of them is $ 7·6·5=210 $ . It is the maximum value we can get.</div>
