<h1>New Year and Rating</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$Limak$ 一共参加了$n$ 场`codeforces`比赛，按时间给出参赛记录，每条记录包括$c_i$ ，$d_i$ 。
$c_i$ 表示在第$i$ 场rating的变化，$d_i$ 有两个可能值：`1`表示$rating\ge 1900$ ;`2`表示$rating<1900$ 。
问$n$ 场之后rating的最大值为多少？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Every Codeforces user has rating, described with one integer, possibly negative or zero. Users are divided into two divisions. The first division is for users with rating $ 1900 $ or higher. Those with rating $ 1899 $ or lower belong to the second division. In every contest, according to one's performance, his or her rating changes by some value, possibly negative or zero.
Limak competed in $ n $ contests in the year 2016. He remembers that in the $ i $ -th contest he competed in the division $ d_{i} $ (i.e. he belonged to this division just before the start of this contest) and his rating changed by $ c_{i} $ just after the contest. Note that negative $ c_{i} $ denotes the loss of rating.
What is the maximum possible rating Limak can have right now, after all $ n $ contests? If his rating may be arbitrarily big, print "Infinity". If there is no scenario matching the given information, print "Impossible".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ).
The $ i $ -th of next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ c_{i} $ and $ d_{i} $ ( $ -100<=c_{i}<=100 $ , $ 1<=d_{i}<=2 $ ), describing Limak's rating change after the $ i $ -th contest and his division during the $ i $ -th contest contest.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Limak's current rating can be arbitrarily big, print "Infinity" (without quotes). If the situation is impossible, print "Impossible" (without quotes). Otherwise print one integer, denoting the maximum possible value of Limak's current rating, i.e. rating after the $ n $ contests.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the following scenario matches all information Limak remembers and has maximum possible final rating:
- Limak has rating $ 1901 $ and belongs to the division $ 1 $ in the first contest. His rating decreases by $ 7 $ .
- With rating $ 1894 $ Limak is in the division $ 2 $ . His rating increases by $ 5 $ .
- Limak has rating $ 1899 $ and is still in the division $ 2 $ . In the last contest of the year he gets $ +8 $ and ends the year with rating $ 1907 $ .
In the second sample, it's impossible that Limak is in the division $ 1 $ , his rating increases by $ 57 $ and after that Limak is in the division $ 2 $ in the second contest.</div>
