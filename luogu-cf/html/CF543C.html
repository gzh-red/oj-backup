<h1>Remembering Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>好记的字符串是n个字符串中，每一个字符串至少有一位是与众不同的。现在给你n个字符串，但是有的字符串不满足与众不同，让你修改某一个或者一些位置的字符串使得满足题意，每一个位置的修改都有对应的花费，问最少的花费是多少。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have multiset of $ n $ strings of the same length, consisting of lowercase English letters. We will say that those strings are easy to remember if for each string there is some position $ i $ and some letter $ c $ of the English alphabet, such that this string is the only string in the multiset that has letter $ c $ in position $ i $ .
For example, a multiset of strings {"abc", "aba", "adc", "ada"} are not easy to remember. And multiset {"abc", "ada", "ssa"} is easy to remember because:
- the first string is the only string that has character $ c $ in position $ 3 $ ;
- the second string is the only string that has character $ d $ in position $ 2 $ ;
- the third string is the only string that has character $ s $ in position $ 2 $ .
You want to change your multiset a little so that it is easy to remember. For $ a_{ij} $ coins, you can change character in the $ j $ -th position of the $ i $ -th string into any other lowercase letter of the English alphabet. Find what is the minimum sum you should pay in order to make the multiset of strings easy to remember.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=20 $ ) — the number of strings in the multiset and the length of the strings respectively. Next $ n $ lines contain the strings of the multiset, consisting only of lowercase English letters, each string's length is $ m $ .
Next $ n $ lines contain $ m $ integers each, the $ i $ -th of them contains integers $ a_{i1},a_{i2},...,a_{im} $ ( $ 0<=a_{ij}<=10^{6} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the answer to the problem.</div>
