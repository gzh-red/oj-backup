<h1>Devu, the Singer and Churu, the Joker</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Devu is a renowned classical singer. He is invited to many big functions/festivals. Recently he was invited to "All World Classical Singing Festival". Other than Devu, comedian Churu was also invited.
Devu has provided organizers a list of the songs and required time for singing them. He will sing $ n $ songs, $ i^{th} $ song will take $ t_{i} $ minutes exactly.
The Comedian, Churu will crack jokes. All his jokes are of 5 minutes exactly.
People have mainly come to listen Devu. But you know that he needs rest of 10 minutes after each song. On the other hand, Churu being a very active person, doesn't need any rest.
You as one of the organizers should make an optimal sсhedule for the event. For some reasons you must follow the conditions:
- The duration of the event must be no more than $ d $ minutes;
- Devu must complete all his songs;
- With satisfying the two previous conditions the number of jokes cracked by Churu should be as many as possible.
If it is not possible to find a way to conduct all the songs of the Devu, output -1. Otherwise find out maximum number of jokes that Churu can crack in the grand event.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space separated integers $ n $ , $ d $ $ (1<=n<=100; 1<=d<=10000) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers: $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ $ (1<=t_{i}<=100) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no way to conduct all the songs of Devu, output -1. Otherwise output the maximum number of jokes that Churu can crack in the grand event.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 30
2 2 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3 20
2 1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>-1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the first example. The duration of the event is $ 30 $ minutes. There could be maximum $ 5 $ jokes in the following way:
- First Churu cracks a joke in $ 5 $ minutes.
- Then Devu performs the first song for $ 2 $ minutes.
- Then Churu cracks $ 2 $ jokes in $ 10 $ minutes.
- Now Devu performs second song for $ 2 $ minutes.
- Then Churu cracks $ 2 $ jokes in $ 10 $ minutes.
- Now finally Devu will perform his last song in $ 1 $ minutes.
Total time spent is $ 5+2+10+2+10+1=30 $ minutes.
Consider the second example. There is no way of organizing Devu's all songs. Hence the answer is -1.</div>
