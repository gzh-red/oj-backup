<h1>Anton and Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一棵$n(n<=200000)$个节点的树，每个点为黑色或白色，一次操作可以使一个相同颜色的连通块变成另一种颜色，求使整棵树变成一种颜色的最少操作数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Anton is growing a tree in his garden. In case you forgot, the tree is a connected acyclic undirected graph.
There are $ n $ vertices in the tree, each of them is painted black or white. Anton doesn't like multicolored trees, so he wants to change the tree such that all vertices have the same color (black or white).
To change the colors Anton can use only operations of one type. We denote it as $ paint(v) $ , where $ v $ is some vertex of the tree. This operation changes the color of all vertices $ u $ such that all vertices on the shortest path from $ v $ to $ u $ have the same color (including $ v $ and $ u $ ). For example, consider the tree
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF734E/e17d4eda0dc67dbbca220a370e8bf45f5d1faeb0.png)and apply operation $ paint(3) $ to get the following:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF734E/eabfeb953964c829d6d1820bd3bcad690b9ae826.png)Anton is interested in the minimum number of operation he needs to perform in order to make the colors of all vertices equal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ color_{i} $ ( $ 0<=color_{i}<=1 $ ) — colors of the vertices. $ color_{i}=0 $ means that the $ i $ -th vertex is initially painted white, while $ color_{i}=1 $ means it's initially painted black.
Then follow $ n-1 $ line, each of them contains a pair of integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}≠v_{i} $ ) — indices of vertices connected by the corresponding edge. It's guaranteed that all pairs $ (u_{i},v_{i}) $ are distinct, i.e. there are no multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum number of operations Anton has to apply in order to make all vertices of the tree black or all vertices of the tree white.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the tree is the same as on the picture. If we first apply operation $ paint(3) $ and then apply $ paint(6) $ , the tree will become completely black, so the answer is $ 2 $ .
In the second sample, the tree is already white, so there is no need to apply any operations and the answer is $ 0 $ .</div>
