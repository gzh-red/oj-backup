<h1>Area of Two Circles&#039; Intersection</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>分别给出两个圆的圆心坐标和半径（(x1,y1),r1和(x2,y2),r2），求两个圆相交部分的面积。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two circles. Find the area of their intersection.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ x_{1},y_{1},r_{1} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{1},y_{1}<=10^{9},1<=r_{1}<=10^{9} $ ) — the position of the center and the radius of the first circle.
The second line contains three integers $ x_{2},y_{2},r_{2} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{9},1<=r_{2}<=10^{9} $ ) — the position of the center and the radius of the second circle.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the area of the intersection of the circles. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
