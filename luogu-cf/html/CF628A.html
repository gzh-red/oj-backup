<h1>Tennis Tournament</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A tennis tournament with $ n $ participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.
The tournament takes place in the following way (below, $ m $ is the number of the participants of the current round):
- let $ k $ be the maximal power of the number $ 2 $ such that $ k<=m $ ,
- $ k $ participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other $ m-k $ participants pass to the next round directly,
- when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes.
Each match requires $ b $ bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides $ p $ towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.
Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.
Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains three integers $ n,b,p $ ( $ 1<=n,b,p<=500 $ ) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers $ x $ and $ y $ — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 2 3

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>20 15

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>8 2 4

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>35 32
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example will be three rounds:
1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match $ 5 $ bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge),
2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another $ 5 $ bottles of water,
3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another $ 5 $ bottles of water.
So in total we need $ 20 $ bottles of water.
In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.</div>
