<h1>Winding polygonal line</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>平面上有$n$个点$A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$，没有三点共线。
你想画一条折线，依次经过$A_{p_1},A_{p_2},\ldots,A_{p_n}$，其中$p_1,p_2,\ldots, p_n$是一个排列。
你画的折线需要满足两条性质：
1、这条折线没有自交，也就是任意两段不相邻的线段都没有公共点。
2、这条线的拐点情况必须符合一个长度为$n-2$的字符串$s$。如果字符串$s$的第$i$个位置是"L"，那么这条折线的第$i$个拐点就必须往左拐，否则就必须往右拐。
输出任意一组合法解。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has $ n $ different points $ A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n $ on the plane. No three of them lie on the same line He wants to place them in some order $ A_{p_1}, A_{p_2}, \ldots, A_{p_n} $ , where $ p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n $ — some permutation of integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
After doing so, he will draw oriented polygonal line on these points, drawing oriented segments from each point to the next in the chosen order. So, for all $ 1 \leq i \leq n-1 $ he will draw oriented segment from point $ A_{p_i} $ to point $ A_{p_{i+1}} $ . He wants to make this polygonal line satisfying $ 2 $ conditions:
- it will be non-self-intersecting, so any $ 2 $ segments which are not neighbors don't have common points.
- it will be winding.
Vasya has a string $ s $ , consisting of $ (n-2) $ symbols "L" or "R". Let's call an oriented polygonal line winding, if its $ i $ -th turn left, if $ s_i = $ "L" and right, if $ s_i = $ "R". More formally: $ i $ -th turn will be in point $ A_{p_{i+1}} $ , where oriented segment from point $ A_{p_i} $ to point $ A_{p_{i+1}} $ changes to oriented segment from point $ A_{p_{i+1}} $ to point $ A_{p_{i+2}} $ . Let's define vectors $ \overrightarrow{v_1} = \overrightarrow{A_{p_i} A_{p_{i+1}}} $ and $ \overrightarrow{v_2} = \overrightarrow{A_{p_{i+1}} A_{p_{i+2}}} $ . Then if in order to rotate the vector $ \overrightarrow{v_1} $ by the smallest possible angle, so that its direction coincides with the direction of the vector $ \overrightarrow{v_2} $ we need to make a turn counterclockwise, then we say that $ i $ -th turn is to the left, and otherwise to the right. For better understanding look at this pictures with some examples of turns:

Find a permutation $ p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n $ of the integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , such that the polygonal line, drawn by Vasya satisfy two necessary conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ — the number of points ( $ 3 \leq n \leq 2000 $ ). Next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ , divided by space — coordinates of the point $ A_i $ on the plane ( $ -10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 $ ). The last line contains a string $ s $ consisting of symbols "L" and "R" with length $ (n-2) $ . It is guaranteed that all points are different and no three points lie at the same line.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the satisfying permutation doesn't exists, print $ -1 $ . In the other case, print $ n $ numbers $ p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n $ — the permutation which was found ( $ 1 \leq p_i \leq n $ and all $ p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n $ are different). If there exists more than one solution, you can find any.</div>
