<h1>Minimizing Difference</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;有一个长度为n的序列，每次操作可以使其中的一个数+1或-1。
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;操作次数不得大于k，问MAX-MIN的最小值是多少。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ consisting of $ n $ integers.
You may perform the following operation on this sequence: choose any element and either increase or decrease it by one.
Calculate the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than $ k $ times.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (2 \le n \le 10^{5}, 1 \le k \le 10^{14}) $ — the number of elements in the sequence and the maximum number of times you can perform the operation, respectively.
The second line contains a sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ $ (1 \le a_i \le 10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than $ k $ times.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you can increase the first element twice and decrease the third element twice, so the sequence becomes $ [3, 3, 5, 5] $ , and the difference between maximum and minimum is $ 2 $ . You still can perform one operation after that, but it's useless since you can't make the answer less than $ 2 $ .
In the second example all elements are already equal, so you may get $ 0 $ as the answer even without applying any operations.</div>
