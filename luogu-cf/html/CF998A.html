<h1>Balloons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are quite a lot of ways to have fun with inflatable balloons. For example, you can fill them with water and see what happens.
Grigory and Andrew have the same opinion. So, once upon a time, they went to the shop and bought $ n $ packets with inflatable balloons, where $ i $ -th of them has exactly $ a_i $ balloons inside.
They want to divide the balloons among themselves. In addition, there are several conditions to hold:
- Do not rip the packets (both Grigory and Andrew should get unbroken packets);
- Distribute all packets (every packet should be given to someone);
- Give both Grigory and Andrew at least one packet;
- To provide more fun, the total number of balloons in Grigory's packets should not be equal to the total number of balloons in Andrew's packets.
Help them to divide the balloons or determine that it's impossible under these conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10 $ ) — the number of packets with balloons.
The second line contains $ n $ integers: $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , $ \ldots $ , $ a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 1000 $ ) — the number of balloons inside the corresponding packet.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it's impossible to divide the balloons satisfying the conditions above, print $ -1 $ .
Otherwise, print an integer $ k $ — the number of packets to give to Grigory followed by $ k $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ — the indices of those. The order of packets doesn't matter.
If there are multiple ways to divide balloons, output any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test Grigory gets $ 3 $ balloons in total while Andrey gets $ 1 $ .
In the second test there's only one way to divide the packets which leads to equal numbers of balloons.
In the third test one of the boys won't get a packet at all.</div>
