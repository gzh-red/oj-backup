<h1>Lena and Queries</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Lena is a programmer. She got a task to solve at work.
There is an empty set of pairs of integers and $ n $ queries to process. Each query is one of three types:
1. Add a pair $ (a,b) $ to the set.
2. Remove a pair added in the query number $ i $ . All queries are numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
3. For a given integer $ q $ find the maximal value $ x·q+y $ over all pairs $ (x,y) $ from the set.
Help Lena to process the queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of queries.
Each of the next $ n $ lines starts with integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=3 $ ) — the type of the query.
A pair of integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a,b<=10^{9} $ ) follows in the query of the first type.
An integer $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) follows in the query of the second type. It is guaranteed that $ i $ is less than the number of the query, the query number $ i $ has the first type and the pair from the $ i $ -th query is not already removed.
An integer $ q $ ( $ -10^{9}<=q<=10^{9} $ ) follows in the query of the third type.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For the queries of the third type print on a separate line the desired maximal value of $ x·q+y $ .
If there are no pairs in the set print "EMPTY SET".</div>
