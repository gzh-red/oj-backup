<h1>Points</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
你有n个点，请编写一个程序，求这n个点的距离的平方和。
输入输出格式
输入：
第一行：n（0≤n≤100000）；
接下来n行：每行两个数x，y，表示该点坐标（-10000≤x，y≤10000）。
输出：仅一行：所有点的距离的平方和。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ N $ points on a plane. Write a program which will find the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains one integer number $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=100000 $ ) — the number of points. Each of the following $ N $ lines contain two integer numbers $ X $ and $ Y $ ( $ -10000<=X,Y<=10000 $ ) — the coordinates of points. Two or more points may coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of output should contain the required sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points.</div>
