<h1>Bus Video System</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一辆巴士，开始车上的人数未知，巴士会经过$n$个站点，巴士最多能容纳的人数为$w$，给出在每个站点的上下车人数，任何时刻车上的人数都应该在0到$w$之间，求出车上一开始可能有几个人。如果方案不存在，输出0。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The busses in Berland are equipped with a video surveillance system. The system records information about changes in the number of passengers in a bus after stops.
If $ x $ is the number of passengers in a bus just before the current bus stop and $ y $ is the number of passengers in the bus just after current bus stop, the system records the number $ y-x $ . So the system records show how number of passengers changed.
The test run was made for single bus and $ n $ bus stops. Thus, the system recorded the sequence of integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ (exactly one number for each bus stop), where $ a_i $ is the record for the bus stop $ i $ . The bus stops are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in chronological order.
Determine the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $ w $ (that is, at any time in the bus there should be from $ 0 $ to $ w $ passengers inclusive).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ w $ $ (1 \le n \le 1\,000, 1 \le w \le 10^{9}) $ — the number of bus stops and the capacity of the bus.
The second line contains a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ $ (-10^{6} \le a_i \le 10^{6}) $ , where $ a_i $ equals to the number, which has been recorded by the video system after the $ i $ -th bus stop.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to $ w $ . If the situation is contradictory (i.e. for any initial number of passengers there will be a contradiction), print 0.</div>

<div>In the first example initially in the bus could be $ 0 $ , $ 1 $ or $ 2 $ passengers.
In the second example initially in the bus could be $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ or $ 4 $ passengers.
In the third example initially in the bus could be $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ passenger.</div>
