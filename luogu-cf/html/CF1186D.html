<h1>Vus the Cossack and Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n$个和为$0$实数$a_i$
需要构造一个同样和为$0$整数序列$b_i,$使得对于任意$i$有$b_i=\lceil a_i \rceil$或$b_i=\lfloor a_i \rfloor$.其中$\lceil a_i \rceil$表示大于$a_i$的最小整数，$\lfloor a_i \rfloor$表示小于$a_i$的最大整数。
注意当且仅当$a_i$是整数时，$\lfloor a_i \rfloor =\lceil a_i \rceil. $</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vus the Cossack has $ n $ real numbers $ a_i $ . It is known that the sum of all numbers is equal to $ 0 $ . He wants to choose a sequence $ b $ the size of which is $ n $ such that the sum of all numbers is $ 0 $ and each $ b_i $ is either $ \lfloor a_i \rfloor $ or $ \lceil a_i \rceil $ . In other words, $ b_i $ equals $ a_i $ rounded up or down. It is not necessary to round to the nearest integer.
For example, if $ a = [4.58413, 1.22491, -2.10517, -3.70387] $ , then $ b $ can be equal, for example, to $ [4, 2, -2, -4] $ .
Note that if $ a_i $ is an integer, then there is no difference between $ \lfloor a_i \rfloor $ and $ \lceil a_i \rceil $ , $ b_i $ will always be equal to $ a_i $ .
Help Vus the Cossack find such sequence!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ ) — the number of numbers.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains one real number $ a_i $ ( $ |a_i| < 10^5 $ ). It is guaranteed that each $ a_i $ has exactly $ 5 $ digits after the decimal point. It is guaranteed that the sum of all the numbers is equal to $ 0 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In each of the next $ n $ lines, print one integer $ b_i $ . For each $ i $ , $ |a_i-b_i|<1 $ must be met.
If there are multiple answers, print any.</div>
