<h1>HQ9+【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目背景
HQ9+是一种程序，仅存在4个指令：
- "H",输出“Hello, World!"
- "Q",输出整个源代码（每次输入时都需要输出）
- "9",输出"99 Bottles of Beer"的歌词
- "+",递增并存储程序内累加器的值
说明："H","Q"区分大小写,指令必须是大写。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
输入由字符串p一行组成
p将是HQ9+程序的输入
p将包含1-100个字符（包括），每个字符的ASCII码在33( ! )和126( ~ )之间（包含）。
### 输出格式
如果程序产生输出，输出“YES”，否则输出“NO”
## 样例
### 输入#1
Hello!
### 输出#1
YES
### 输入#2
Progopedia
### 输出#2
NO
### 样例说明
第一种情况下，程序仅包含一个指令"H",打印"Hello, World!"
第二种情况下，没有指令，不产生输出</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:
- "H" prints "Hello, World!",
- "Q" prints the whole source code of the program itself (at each call),
- "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,
- "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.
Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.
You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input will consist of a single line $ p $ which will give a program in HQ9+. String $ p $ will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of $ p $ will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Hello!
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Progopedia
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case the program contains only one instruction — "H", which prints "Hello, World!".
In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.</div>
