<h1>Equalize Prices</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个长度为$n$的序列$a_1\dots a_n$和一个非负整数$k$。
对于序列中的每一个数，你可以令$ai=ai+v$，满足$|v|\le k$。
你想让最后的序列中所有的数都相等。在此基础上，你还想使得最后的数字最大。
输出这个最大的数。如果不能使得所有数都相等，输出$-1$。
你需要回答$q$组询问。
$\text{——by wucstdio}$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ products in the shop. The price of the $ i $ -th product is $ a_i $ . The owner of the shop wants to equalize the prices of all products. However, he wants to change prices smoothly.
In fact, the owner of the shop can change the price of some product $ i $ in such a way that the difference between the old price of this product $ a_i $ and the new price $ b_i $ is at most $ k $ . In other words, the condition $ |a_i - b_i| \le k $ should be satisfied ( $ |x| $ is the absolute value of $ x $ ).
He can change the price for each product not more than once. Note that he can leave the old prices for some products. The new price $ b_i $ of each product $ i $ should be positive (i.e. $ b_i > 0 $ should be satisfied for all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ).
Your task is to find out the maximum possible equal price $ B $ of all productts with the restriction that for all products the condiion $ |a_i - B| \le k $ should be satisfied (where $ a_i $ is the old price of the product and $ B $ is the same new price of all products) or report that it is impossible to find such price $ B $ .
Note that the chosen price $ B $ should be integer.
You should answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 100 $ ) — the number of queries. Each query is presented by two lines.
The first line of the query contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le k \le 10^8 $ ) — the number of products and the value $ k $ . The second line of the query contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^8 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the price of the $ i $ -th product.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers, where the $ i $ -th integer is the answer $ B $ on the $ i $ -th query.
If it is impossible to equalize prices of all given products with restriction that for all products the condition $ |a_i - B| \le k $ should be satisfied (where $ a_i $ is the old price of the product and $ B $ is the new equal price of all products), print -1. Otherwise print the maximum possible equal price of all products.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example query you can choose the price $ B=2 $ . It is easy to see that the difference between each old price and each new price $ B=2 $ is no more than $ 1 $ .
In the second example query you can choose the price $ B=6 $ and then all the differences between old and new price $ B=6 $ will be no more than $ 2 $ .
In the third example query you cannot choose any suitable price $ B $ . For any value $ B $ at least one condition out of two will be violated: $ |1-B| \le 2 $ , $ |6-B| \le 2 $ .
In the fourth example query all values $ B $ between $ 1 $ and $ 7 $ are valid. But the maximum is $ 7 $ , so it's the answer.</div>
