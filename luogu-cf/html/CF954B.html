<h1>String Typing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入n代表输入一串长度为n的字符串，有两种操作得到输出的字符串：
1 ： 一个一个添加字符，直到添加完为止。
2：可以执行一次复制前面已经添加的字符，把复制的添加到后面，然后继续添加字符，直到添加完。
问最少需要多少步骤，把字符添加完。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters. You have to type this string using your keyboard.
Initially, you have an empty string. Until you type the whole string, you may perform the following operation:
- add a character to the end of the string.
Besides, at most once you may perform one additional operation: copy the string and append it to itself.
For example, if you have to type string abcabca, you can type it in $ 7 $ operations if you type all the characters one by one. However, you can type it in $ 5 $ operations if you type the string abc first and then copy it and type the last character.
If you have to type string aaaaaaaaa, the best option is to type $ 4 $ characters one by one, then copy the string, and then type the remaining character.
Print the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input containing only one integer number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the length of the string you have to type. The second line containing the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer number — the minimum number of operations you need to type the given string.</div>
