<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. To transform the original message into encrypted one using key $ k $ , one has to replace each letter with a letter which is $ k $ positions later in the alphabet (if this takes the position beyond Z, the rest of it is counted from the start of the alphabet). In a more formal way, if letters of the alphabet are enumerated starting with $ 0 $ , the result of encryption for character $ x $ will be ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF470D/0bcdfffb3b376cab4d59991539b7c4c59be3e11b.png) ( $ 26 $ is the number of letters in the Latin alphabet).
You are given the original message and the encryption key $ k $ . Output the result of encryption.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=25 $ ) — the encryption key.
The second line contains the original message — a sequence of uppercase Latin letters ('A'-'Z'). The length of the message is from $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the result of encryption.</div>
