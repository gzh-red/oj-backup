<h1>Optimal Polygon Perimeter</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>1给你n个点的二维坐标，你可以任意选择一些点构成k边形（凸多边形），求出最大的k边形的周长（k=3,4,5,...n），定义两点的距离为曼哈顿距离。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $ n $ points is strictly convex, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , in clockwise order.
We define the distance between two points $ p_1 = (x_1, y_1) $ and $ p_2 = (x_2, y_2) $ as their Manhattan distance: $ $$$d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|. $ $ </p><p>Furthermore, we define the perimeter of a polygon, as the sum of Manhattan distances between all adjacent pairs of points on it; if the points on the polygon are ordered as $ p\_1, p\_2, \\ldots, p\_k $ $ (k \\geq 3) $ , then the perimeter of the polygon is $ d(p\_1, p\_2) + d(p\_2, p\_3) + \\ldots + d(p\_k, p\_1) $ .</p><p>For some parameter $ k $ , let's consider all the polygons that can be formed from the given set of points, having <span class="tex-font-style-bf">any</span> $ k $ vertices, such that the polygon is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not</span> self-intersecting. For each such polygon, let's consider its perimeter. Over all such perimeters, we define $ f(k) $ to be the maximal perimeter.</p><p>Please note, when checking whether a polygon is self-intersecting, that the edges of a polygon are still drawn as straight lines. For instance, in the following pictures:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="/predownloaded/4e/c2/4ec25e6ecb8feac3ac0b9b7fa51a118c2b777e87.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" /> </center><p>In the middle polygon, the order of points ( $ p\_1, p\_3, p\_2, p\_4 $ ) is not valid, since it is a self-intersecting polygon. The right polygon (whose edges resemble the Manhattan distance) has the same order and is not self-intersecting, but we consider edges as straight lines. The correct way to draw this polygon is ( $ p\_1, p\_2, p\_3, p\_4 $ ), which is the left polygon.</p><p>Your task is to compute $ f(3), f(4), \\ldots, f(n) $ . In other words, find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $ 3 $ to $ n$$$).</div>

<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of points.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ -10^8 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^8 $ ) — the coordinates of point $ p_i $ .
The set of points is guaranteed to be convex, all points are distinct, the points are ordered in clockwise order, and there will be no three collinear points.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, for $ f(3) $ , we consider four possible polygons:
- ( $ p_1, p_2, p_3 $ ), with perimeter $ 12 $ .
- ( $ p_1, p_2, p_4 $ ), with perimeter $ 8 $ .
- ( $ p_1, p_3, p_4 $ ), with perimeter $ 12 $ .
- ( $ p_2, p_3, p_4 $ ), with perimeter $ 12 $ .
For $ f(4) $ , there is only one option, taking all the given points. Its perimeter $ 14 $ .
In the second example, there is only one possible polygon. Its perimeter is $ 8 $ .</div>
