<h1>Coloring a Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题面：
一个树，每次可以选择一个子树染成同一个颜色，求染成目标状态的最小操作次数。
输入：
第一行n，第二行pi表示i和pi之间有边，第三行ci表示i点的目标颜色。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rooted tree with $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the root is the vertex number $ 1 $ .
Each vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex $ v $ by $ c_{v} $ . Initially $ c_{v}=0 $ .
You have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex $ v $ and a color $ x $ , and then color all vectices in the subtree of $ v $ (including $ v $ itself) in color $ x $ . In other words, for every vertex $ u $ , such that the path from root to $ u $ passes through $ v $ , set $ c_{u}=x $ .
It is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from $ 0 $ .
You can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\_(graph\_theory)</a>.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{4} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<i $ ), where $ p_{i} $ means that there is an edge between vertices $ i $ and $ p_{i} $ . The third line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=n $ ), where $ c_{i} $ is the color you should color the $ i $ -th vertex into. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.</div>
