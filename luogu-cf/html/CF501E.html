<h1>Misha and Palindrome Degree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Misha has an array of $ n $ integers indexed by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Let's define palindrome degree of array $ a $ as the number of such index pairs $ (l,r)(1<=l<=r<=n) $ , that the elements from the $ l $ -th to the $ r $ -th one inclusive can be rearranged in such a way that the whole array will be a palindrome. In other words, pair $ (l,r) $ should meet the condition that after some rearranging of numbers on positions from $ l $ to $ r $ , inclusive (it is allowed not to rearrange the numbers at all), for any $ 1<=i<=n $ following condition holds: $ a[i]=a[n-i+1] $ .
Your task is to find the palindrome degree of Misha's array.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a[i] $ ( $ 1<=a[i]<=n $ ), separated by spaces — the elements of Misha's array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the answer to the problem.</div>
