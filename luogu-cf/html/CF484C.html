<h1>Strange Sorting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>How many specific orders do you know? Ascending order, descending order, order of ascending length, order of ascending polar angle... Let's have a look at another specific order: $ d $ -sorting. This sorting is applied to the strings of length at least $ d $ , where $ d $ is some positive integer. The characters of the string are sorted in following manner: first come all the 0-th characters of the initial string, then the 1-st ones, then the 2-nd ones and so on, in the end go all the $ (d-1) $ -th characters of the initial string. By the $ i $ -th characters we mean all the character whose positions are exactly $ i $ modulo $ d $ . If two characters stand on the positions with the same remainder of integer division by $ d $ , their relative order after the sorting shouldn't be changed. The string is zero-indexed. For example, for string 'qwerty':
Its 1-sorting is the string 'qwerty' (all characters stand on 0 positions),
Its 2-sorting is the string 'qetwry' (characters 'q', 'e' and 't' stand on 0 positions and characters 'w', 'r' and 'y' are on 1 positions),
Its 3-sorting is the string 'qrwtey' (characters 'q' and 'r' stand on 0 positions, characters 'w' and 't' stand on 1 positions and characters 'e' and 'y' stand on 2 positions),
Its 4-sorting is the string 'qtwyer',
Its 5-sorting is the string 'qywert'.
You are given string $ S $ of length $ n $ and $ m $ shuffling operations of this string. Each shuffling operation accepts two integer arguments $ k $ and $ d $ and transforms string $ S $ as follows. For each $ i $ from $ 0 $ to $ n-k $ in the increasing order we apply the operation of $ d $ -sorting to the substring $ S\[i..i+k-1\] $ . Here $ S\[a..b\] $ represents a substring that consists of characters on positions from $ a $ to $ b $ inclusive.
After each shuffling operation you need to print string $ S $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a non-empty string $ S $ of length $ n $ , consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits from 0 to 9.
The second line of the input contains integer $ m $ – the number of shuffling operations ( $ 1<=m·n<=10^{6} $ ).
Following $ m $ lines contain the descriptions of the operations consisting of two integers $ k $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=d<=k<=n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>After each operation print the current state of string $ S $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>qwerty
3
4 2
6 3
5 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>qertwy
qtewry
qetyrw
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Here is detailed explanation of the sample. The first modification is executed with arguments $ k=4 $ , $ d=2 $ . That means that you need to apply 2-sorting for each substring of length 4 one by one moving from the left to the right. The string will transform in the following manner:
qwerty $ → $ qewrty $ → $ qerwty $ → $ qertwy
Thus, string $ S $ equals 'qertwy' at the end of first query.
The second modification is executed with arguments $ k=6 $ , $ d=3 $ . As a result of this operation the whole string $ S $ is replaced by its 3-sorting:
qertwy $ → $ qtewry
The third modification is executed with arguments $ k=5 $ , $ d=2 $ .
qtewry $ → $ qertwy $ → $ qetyrw</div>
