<h1>Fox And Names</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>记得熟悉的字典序吗？
现在有一些按照某个被改变的字典序（26个字母的顺序不再是abcdefg...xyz）排序后的字符串，请求出其字典序。
###### （存在多组解，请输出任意一组）
###### 否则输出 Impossible（请注意大小写）
数据范围 字符串很开心自己有至多100个字符
其他限制 见右边</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fox Ciel is going to publish a paper on FOCS (Foxes Operated Computer Systems, pronounce: "Fox"). She heard a rumor: the authors list on the paper is always sorted in the lexicographical order.
After checking some examples, she found out that sometimes it wasn't true. On some papers authors' names weren't sorted in lexicographical order in normal sense. But it was always true that after some modification of the order of letters in alphabet, the order of authors becomes lexicographical!
She wants to know, if there exists an order of letters in Latin alphabet such that the names on the paper she is submitting are following in the lexicographical order. If so, you should find out any such order.
Lexicographical order is defined in following way. When we compare $ s $ and $ t $ , first we find the leftmost position with differing characters: $ s_{i}≠t_{i} $ . If there is no such position (i. e. $ s $ is a prefix of $ t $ or vice versa) the shortest string is less. Otherwise, we compare characters $ s_{i} $ and $ t_{i} $ according to their order in alphabet.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ): number of names.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contain one string $ name_{i} $ ( $ 1<=|name_{i}|<=100 $ ), the $ i $ -th name. Each name contains only lowercase Latin letters. All names are different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there exists such order of letters that the given names are sorted lexicographically, output any such order as a permutation of characters 'a'–'z' (i. e. first output the first letter of the modified alphabet, then the second, and so on).
Otherwise output a single word "Impossible" (without quotes).</div>
