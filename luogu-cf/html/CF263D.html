<h1>Cycle in Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got a undirected graph $ G $ , consisting of $ n $ nodes. We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to $ n $ . We know that each node of graph $ G $ is connected by edges with at least $ k $ other nodes of this graph. Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least $ k+1 $ .
A simple cycle of length $ d $ $ (d&gt;1) $ in graph $ G $ is a sequence of distinct graph nodes $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{d} $ such, that nodes $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{d} $ are connected by an edge of the graph, also for any integer $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;d) $ nodes $ v_{i} $ and $ v_{i+1} $ are connected by an edge of the graph.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ $ (3<=n,m<=10^{5}; 2<=k<=n-1) $ — the number of the nodes of the graph, the number of the graph's edges and the lower limit on the degree of the graph node. Next $ m $ lines contain pairs of integers. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n; a_{i}≠b_{i}) $ — the indexes of the graph nodes that are connected by the $ i $ -th edge.
It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any multiple edges or self-loops. It is guaranteed that each node of the graph is connected by the edges with at least $ k $ other nodes of the graph.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print integer $ r $ $ (r>=k+1) $ — the length of the found cycle. In the next line print $ r $ distinct integers $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{r} $ $ (1<=v_{i}<=n) $ — the found simple cycle.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
