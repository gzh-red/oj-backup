<h1>Happy Birthday</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
简单来说就是有0-9的每个数字c[i]个，问最小的y使得这个组合可以拼出1~y-1的所有数。
例如C0=C1=C2=C3=...=C9=1可以表示出1~10的所有数，而不能表示11，所以输出11。
# 输入格式
第一行一个数t，表示有t(1≤t≤10^
4)组数据。
接下来t行每行9个数表示Ci (0≤ci≤10^5)。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a set of birthday cake candles. Each of such candles represents a digit between $ 0 $ and $ 9 $ , inclusive.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1250H/d5cd74fe7ac15db0e75f654137471b0878202976.png)Example of birthday cake candles.Let's denote the candle representing the digit $ d $ as $ d $ -candle.
Your set contains $ c_0 $ instances of $ 0 $ -candles, $ c_1 $ instances of $ 1 $ -candles and so on. So, the total number of candles is $ c_0+c_1+\dots+c_9 $ .
These digits are needed to wish your cat a happy birthday. For each birthday, starting with the first, you want to compose the age of the cat using the digits from the set.
Since you light candles for a very short time, candles don't have time to burn out. For this reason you can reuse candles an arbitrary number of times (therefore your set of candles never changes).
For example, if you have one instance of each digit (i.e. $ c_0=c_1=\dots=c_9=1 $ ), you can compose any number from $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ using this set, but you cannot compose $ 11 $ .
You have to determine the first birthday, on which you cannot compose the age of the cat using the candles from your set. In other words, find the minimum number $ y $ such that all numbers from $ 1 $ to $ y-1 $ can be composed by digits from your set, but $ y $ cannot be composed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases in the input.
The only line of each test case contains ten integer numbers $ c_0, c_1, \dots, c_9 $ ( $ 0 \le c_i \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of $ 0 $ -candles, $ 1 $ -candles, $ 2 $ -candles and so on.
It is guaranteed that the sum of all $ c_i $ in the input does not exceed $ 10^6 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one integer in single line — the minimum age which cannot be composed by candles from your set. Please note that the age can be quite large (it may exceed the standard 64-bit integer types in your programming language).</div>
