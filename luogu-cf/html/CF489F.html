<h1>Special Matrices</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>An $ n×n $ square matrix is special, if:
- it is binary, that is, each cell contains either a 0, or a 1;
- the number of ones in each row and column equals 2.
You are given $ n $ and the first $ m $ rows of the matrix. Print the number of special $ n×n $ matrices, such that the first $ m $ rows coincide with the given ones.
As the required value can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the value by the given number $ mod $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ mod $ ( $ 2<=n<=500 $ , $ 0<=m<=n $ , $ 2<=mod<=10^{9} $ ). Then $ m $ lines follow, each of them contains $ n $ characters — the first rows of the required special matrices. Each of these lines contains exactly two characters '1', the rest characters are '0'. Each column of the given $ m×n $ table contains at most two numbers one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the remainder after dividing the required value by number $ mod $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first test the required matrices are:
`<br></br>011<br></br>101<br></br>110<br></br><br></br>011<br></br>110<br></br>101<br></br>`In the second test the required matrix is already fully given, so the answer is 1.</div>
