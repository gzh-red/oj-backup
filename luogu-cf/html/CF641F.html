<h1>Little Artem and 2-SAT</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Artem is a very smart programmer. He knows many different difficult algorithms. Recently he has mastered in 2-SAT one.
In computer science, 2-satisfiability (abbreviated as 2-SAT) is the special case of the problem of determining whether a conjunction (logical AND) of disjunctions (logical OR) have a solution, in which all disjunctions consist of no more than two arguments (variables). For the purpose of this problem we consider only 2-SAT formulas where each disjunction consists of exactly two arguments.
Consider the following 2-SAT problem as an example: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF641F/668de4b7e3b5177b51ec0e425d95844b629806be.png). Note that there might be negations in 2-SAT formula (like for $ x_{1} $ and for $ x_{4} $ ).
Artem now tries to solve as many problems with 2-SAT as possible. He found a very interesting one, which he can not solve yet. Of course, he asks you to help him.
The problem is: given two 2-SAT formulas $ f $ and $ g $ , determine whether their sets of possible solutions are the same. Otherwise, find any variables assignment $ x $ such that $ f(x)≠g(x) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m_{1} $ and $ m_{2} $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=m_{1},m_{2}<=n^{2} $ ) — the number of variables, the number of disjunctions in the first formula and the number of disjunctions in the second formula, respectively.
Next $ m_{1} $ lines contains the description of 2-SAT formula $ f $ . The description consists of exactly $ m_{1} $ pairs of integers $ x_{i} $ ( $ -n<=x_{i}<=n,x_{i}≠0 $ ) each on separate line, where $ x_{i}&gt;0 $ corresponds to the variable without negation, while $ x_{i}&lt;0 $ corresponds to the variable with negation. Each pair gives a single disjunction. Next $ m_{2} $ lines contains formula $ g $ in the similar format.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If both formulas share the same set of solutions, output a single word "SIMILAR" (without quotes). Otherwise output exactly $ n $ integers $ x_{i} $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF641F/4a63e3cf7c719a17a2dfeeb9e9b22e318f6f7ab8.png)) — any set of values $ x $ such that $ f(x)≠g(x) $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>First sample has two equal formulas, so they are similar by definition.
In second sample if we compute first function with $ x_{1}=0 $ and $ x_{2}=0 $ we get the result $ 0 $ , because ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF641F/b45af558ac7c684877a4b0ed7b500ed5fd6814ca.png). But the second formula is $ 1 $ , because ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF641F/e19f3595ba7f8fd8aafb028618af4e8d920e7f26.png).</div>
