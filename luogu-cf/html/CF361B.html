<h1>Levko and Permutation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Levko loves permutations very much. A permutation of length $ n $ is a sequence of distinct positive integers, each is at most $ n $ .
Let’s assume that value $ gcd(a,b) $ shows the greatest common divisor of numbers $ a $ and $ b $ . Levko assumes that element $ p_{i} $ of permutation $ p_{1},p_{2},...\ ,p_{n} $ is good if $ gcd(i,p_{i})&gt;1 $ . Levko considers a permutation beautiful, if it has exactly $ k $ good elements. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=k<=n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print either any beautiful permutation or -1, if such permutation doesn’t exist.
If there are multiple suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 4 3 1</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>-1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample elements $ 4 $ and $ 3 $ are good because $ gcd(2,4)=2&gt;1 $ and $ gcd(3,3)=3&gt;1 $ . Elements $ 2 $ and $ 1 $ are not good because $ gcd(1,2)=1 $ and $ gcd(4,1)=1 $ . As there are exactly 2 good elements, the permutation is beautiful.
The second sample has no beautiful permutations.</div>
