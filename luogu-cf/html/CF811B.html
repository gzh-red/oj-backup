<h1>Vladik and Complicated Book</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个长度为n的排列，每次选一段区间$[l,r]$排序，问位置$x$上的数在排序前后是否发生了改变。保证$x\in[l,r]$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vladik had started reading a complicated book about algorithms containing $ n $ pages. To improve understanding of what is written, his friends advised him to read pages in some order given by permutation $ P=[p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n}] $ , where $ p_{i} $ denotes the number of page that should be read $ i $ -th in turn.
Sometimes Vladik’s mom sorted some subsegment of permutation $ P $ from position $ l $ to position $ r $ inclusive, because she loves the order. For every of such sorting Vladik knows number $ x $ — what index of page in permutation he should read. He is wondered if the page, which he will read after sorting, has changed. In other words, has $ p_{x} $ changed? After every sorting Vladik return permutation to initial state, so you can assume that each sorting is independent from each other.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{4} $ ) — length of permutation and number of times Vladik's mom sorted some subsegment of the book.
Second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ ) — permutation $ P $ . Note that elements in permutation are distinct.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains three space-separated integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ , $ x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=x_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ) — left and right borders of sorted subsegment in $ i $ -th sorting and position that is interesting to Vladik.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each mom’s sorting on it’s own line print "Yes", if page which is interesting to Vladik hasn't changed, or "No" otherwise.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Explanation of first test case:
1. $ [1,2,3,4,5] $ — permutation after sorting, $ 3 $ -rd element hasn’t changed, so answer is "Yes".
2. $ [3,4,5,2,1] $ — permutation after sorting, $ 1 $ -st element has changed, so answer is "No".
3. $ [5,2,3,4,1] $ — permutation after sorting, $ 3 $ -rd element hasn’t changed, so answer is "Yes".
4. $ [5,4,3,2,1] $ — permutation after sorting, $ 4 $ -th element hasn’t changed, so answer is "Yes".
5. $ [5,1,2,3,4] $ — permutation after sorting, $ 3 $ -rd element has changed, so answer is "No".</div>
