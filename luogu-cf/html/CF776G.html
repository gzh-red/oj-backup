<h1>Sherlock and the Encrypted Data</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sherlock found a piece of encrypted data which he thinks will be useful to catch Moriarty. The encrypted data consists of two integer $ l $ and $ r $ . He noticed that these integers were in hexadecimal form.
He takes each of the integers from $ l $ to $ r $ , and performs the following operations:
1. He lists the distinct digits present in the given number. For example: for $ 1014_{16} $ , he lists the digits as $ 1,0,4 $ .
2. Then he sums respective powers of two for each digit listed in the step above. Like in the above example $ sum=2^{1}+2^{0}+2^{4}=19_{10} $ .
3. He changes the initial number by applying bitwise xor of the initial number and the sum. Example: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF776G/959289a189ff1fca05b0806d5e720756eddc35a9.png). Note that xor is done in binary notation.
One more example: for integer 1e the sum is $ sum=2^{1}+2^{14} $ . Letters a, b, c, d, e, f denote hexadecimal digits $ 10 $ , $ 11 $ , $ 12 $ , $ 13 $ , $ 14 $ , $ 15 $ , respertively.
Sherlock wants to count the numbers in the range from $ l $ to $ r $ (both inclusive) which decrease on application of the above four steps. He wants you to answer his $ q $ queries for different $ l $ and $ r $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains the integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10000 $ ).
Each of the next $ q $ lines contain two hexadecimal integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 0<=l<=r&lt;16^{15} $ ).
The hexadecimal integers are written using digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ and/or lowercase English letters a, b, c, d, e, f.
The hexadecimal integers do not contain extra leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ q $ lines, $ i $ -th line contains answer to the $ i $ -th query (in decimal notation).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the second input,
$ 14_{16}=20_{10} $
$ sum=2^{1}+2^{4}=18 $

Thus, it reduces. And, we can verify that it is the only number in range $ 1 $ to $ 1e $ that reduces.</div>
