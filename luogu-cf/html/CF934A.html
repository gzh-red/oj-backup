<h1>A Compatible Pair</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定两个数列 $A$ 、 $B$ ，元素个数分别为 $n$ ，$m$ $(2<=n,m<=50)$ 。数列中所有元素大小均在 $-10^{9}$ 到 $10^{9}$ 之间。
现要求在 $A$ 数列中删掉一个元素，使得 $A$ 中任一元素和 $B$ 中任一元素相乘的共 $(n-1) \times m$ 种可能的值中的最大值最小。输出该最大值。
感谢 @Tweetuzki 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Nian is a monster which lives deep in the oceans. Once a year, it shows up on the land, devouring livestock and even people. In order to keep the monster away, people fill their villages with red colour, light, and cracking noise, all of which frighten the monster out of coming.
Little Tommy has $ n $ lanterns and Big Banban has $ m $ lanterns. Tommy's lanterns have brightness $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , and Banban's have brightness $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ respectively.
Tommy intends to hide one of his lanterns, then Banban picks one of Tommy's non-hidden lanterns and one of his own lanterns to form a pair. The pair's brightness will be the product of the brightness of two lanterns.
Tommy wants to make the product as small as possible, while Banban tries to make it as large as possible.
You are asked to find the brightness of the chosen pair if both of them choose optimally.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n,m<=50 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ .
The third line contains $ m $ space-separated integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ .
All the integers range from $ -10^{9} $ to $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the brightness of the chosen pair.</div>
