<h1>All the Vowels Please</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>`NaCly_Fish`是一个十分喜欢元音的小姐姐。
她想让您找到一个恰好有$k(1\le k\le 10^4)$个格子的矩阵，满足这个矩阵中每一行每一列都包含了所有元音（`a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`）
至于矩阵的行列数，由您自己决定。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tom loves vowels, and he likes long words with many vowels. His favorite words are vowelly words. We say a word of length $ k $ is vowelly if there are positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ such that $ n\cdot m = k $ and when the word is written by using $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns (the first row is filled first, then the second and so on, with each row filled from left to right), every vowel of the English alphabet appears at least once in every row and every column.
You are given an integer $ k $ and you must either print a vowelly word of length $ k $ or print $ -1 $ if no such word exists.
In this problem the vowels of the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' ,'u'.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of a single line containing the integer $ k $ ( $ 1\leq k \leq 10^4 $ ) — the required length.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output must consist of a single line, consisting of a vowelly word of length $ k $ consisting of lowercase English letters if it exists or $ -1 $ if it does not.
If there are multiple possible words, you may output any of them.</div>
