<h1>TV Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## Description
给你一个长度为$2n$的数字$S$，同时你还有两个初始为$0$的数字$A,B$。每次你可以将$S$中最靠左的一位在$S$中删除掉，并接在$A$或者$B$其中一个的后面。要求整个操作结束后，必须$A$与$B$都恰好被接$n$次。最大化$A+B$的值，输出方案。
## Input
第一行是一个整数$n$。
第二行是一个长度为$2n$的数字代表$S$
## Output
输出一行长度为$2n$的由$H$和$M$组成的字符串。如果$S$的第$i$位接到了$A$后面，则输出字符串的第$i$为是$H$。否则是$M$.
## Hint
$0~\leq~n~\leq~18$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a new TV game on BerTV. In this game two players get a number $ A $ consisting of $ 2n $ digits. Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly $ n $ moves. On it's turn $ i $ -th player takes the leftmost digit of $ A $ and appends it to his or her number $ S_{i} $ . After that this leftmost digit is erased from $ A $ . Initially the numbers of both players ( $ S_{1} $ and $ S_{2} $ ) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers $ A,S_{1},S_{2} $ are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets $ S_{1} $ dollars, and the second gets $ S_{2} $ dollars.
One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number $ A $ beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly $ n $ moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=18 $ ). The second line contains integer $ A $ consisting of exactly $ 2n $ digits. This number can have leading zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the line of $ 2n $ characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly $ n $ moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.</div>
