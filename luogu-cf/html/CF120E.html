<h1>Put Knight!</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya and Gena play a very interesting game "Put a Knight!" on a chessboard $ n×n $ in size. In this game they take turns to put chess pieces called "knights" on the board so that no two knights could threat each other. A knight located in square $ (r,c) $ can threat squares $ (r-1,c+2) $ , $ (r-1,c-2) $ , $ (r+1,c+2) $ , $ (r+1,c-2) $ , $ (r-2,c+1) $ , $ (r-2,c-1) $ , $ (r+2,c+1) $ and $ (r+2,c-1) $ (some of the squares may be located outside the chessboard). The player who can't put a new knight during his move loses. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally well and Petya starts.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ T $ ( $ 1<=T<=100 $ ) — the number of boards, for which you should determine the winning player. Next $ T $ lines contain $ T $ integers $ n_{i} $ ( $ 1<=n_{i}<=10000 $ ) — the sizes of the chessboards.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each $ n_{i}×n_{i} $ board print on a single line "0" if Petya wins considering both players play optimally well. Otherwise, print "1".</div>
