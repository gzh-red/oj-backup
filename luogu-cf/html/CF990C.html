<h1>Bracket Sequences Concatenation Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n个字符串，保证只包含'('和')'，求从中取2个字符串链接后形成正确的括号序列的方案数（每个串都可以重复使用）（像'()()'和'(())'这样的都是合法的，像')('和'('这样的是不合法的）
输入：
第一行一个整数n
第二行到第n+1行每行一个字符串
输出：
方案数
感谢@zhaotiensn 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")".
A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.
You are given $ n $ bracket sequences $ s_1, s_2, \dots , s_n $ . Calculate the number of pairs $ i, j \, (1 \le i, j \le n) $ such that the bracket sequence $ s_i + s_j $ is a regular bracket sequence. Operation $ + $ means concatenation i.e. "()(" + ")()" = "()()()".
If $ s_i + s_j $ and $ s_j + s_i $ are regular bracket sequences and $ i \ne j $ , then both pairs $ (i, j) $ and $ (j, i) $ must be counted in the answer. Also, if $ s_i + s_i $ is a regular bracket sequence, the pair $ (i, i) $ must be counted in the answer.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n \, (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5) $ — the number of bracket sequences. The following $ n $ lines contain bracket sequences — non-empty strings consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The sum of lengths of all bracket sequences does not exceed $ 3 \cdot 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print a single integer — the number of pairs $ i, j \, (1 \le i, j \le n) $ such that the bracket sequence $ s_i + s_j $ is a regular bracket sequence.</div>
