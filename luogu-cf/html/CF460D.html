<h1>Little Victor and Set</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个区间l,r与一个数k。
在l~r中找不超过k个数（不能重复选），使得这些数的异或和最小，输出任意方案。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Victor adores the sets theory. Let us remind you that a set is a group of numbers where all numbers are pairwise distinct. Today Victor wants to find a set of integers $ S $ that has the following properties:
- for all $ x $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF460D/26c8948a606517ebae5f50ff9b8fc7d91f76f3df.png) the following inequality holds $ l<=x<=r $ ;
- $ 1<=|S|<=k $ ;
- lets denote the $ i $ -th element of the set $ S $ as $ s_{i} $ ; value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF460D/7523823a9f324064de1df35c0e0503740f7be786.png) must be as small as possible.
Help Victor find the described set.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers $ l,r,k $ $ (1<=l<=r<=10^{12}; 1<=k<=min(10^{6},r-l+1)) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum possible value of $ f(S) $ . Then print the cardinality of set $ |S| $ . Then print the elements of the set in any order.
If there are multiple optimal sets, you can print any of them.</div>
