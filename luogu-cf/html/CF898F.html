<h1>Restoring the Expression</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【翻译】
给定一个数字串，要求在串中插入'+'和'='，使得这个数字串变成一个成立的等式。要求如下：
1.'+'必须在'='前面
2.加数与和都不能有前导0，且非空。
输入保证有解。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A correct expression of the form a+b=c was written; $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ are non-negative integers without leading zeros. In this expression, the plus and equally signs were lost. The task is to restore the expression. In other words, one character '+' and one character '=' should be inserted into given sequence of digits so that:
- character'+' is placed on the left of character '=',
- characters '+' and '=' split the sequence into three non-empty subsequences consisting of digits (let's call the left part a, the middle part — b and the right part — c),
- all the three parts a, b and c do not contain leading zeros,
- it is true that a+b=c.
It is guaranteed that in given tests answer always exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a non-empty string consisting of digits. The length of the string does not exceed $ 10^{6} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the restored expression. If there are several solutions, you can print any of them.
Note that the answer at first should contain two terms (divided with symbol '+'), and then the result of their addition, before which symbol'=' should be.
Do not separate numbers and operation signs with spaces. Strictly follow the output format given in the examples.
If you remove symbol '+' and symbol '=' from answer string you should get a string, same as string from the input data.</div>
