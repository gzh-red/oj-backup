<h1>Mahmoud and Ehab and yet another xor task</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ehab has an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers. He likes the [bitwise-xor operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) and he likes to bother Mahmoud so he came up with a problem. He gave Mahmoud $ q $ queries. In each of them, he gave Mahmoud 2 integers $ l $ and $ x $ , and asked him to find the number of subsequences of the first $ l $ elements of the array such that their bitwise-xor sum is $ x $ . Can you help Mahmoud answer the queries?
A subsequence can contain elements that are not neighboring.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ q $ $ (1<=n,q<=10^{5}) $ , the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{n} $ $ (0<=a_{i}<2^{20}) $ , the elements of the array.
The next $ q $ lines, each contains integers $ l $ and $ x $ $ (1<=l<=n $ , $ 0<=x<2^{20}) $ , representing the queries.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query, output its answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ in a newline.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 5

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The bitwise-xor sum of the empty set is 0 and the bitwise-xor sum of a set containing one element is that element itself.</div>
