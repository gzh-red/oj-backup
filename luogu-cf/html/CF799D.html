<h1>Field expansion</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are $ n $ extensions, the $ i $ -th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by $ a_{i} $ . Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order.
Now Arkady's field has size $ h×w $ . He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size $ a×b $ on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains five integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ h $ , $ w $ and $ n $ ( $ 1<=a,b,h,w,n<=100000 $ ) — the sizes of the rectangle needed to be placed, the initial sizes of the field and the number of available extensions.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 2<=a_{i}<=100000 $ ), where $ a_{i} $ equals the integer a side multiplies by when the $ i $ -th extension is applied.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal. If it is not possible to place the rectangle on the field with all extensions, print -1. If the rectangle can be placed on the initial field, print 0.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it is enough to use any of the extensions available. For example, we can enlarge $ h $ in $ 5 $ times using the second extension. Then $ h $ becomes equal $ 10 $ and it is now possible to place the rectangle on the field.</div>
