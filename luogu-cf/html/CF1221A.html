<h1>2048 Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你在玩游戏$2048$的变种，初始你有一个可重集合，其中每个数都是$2$的幂次，你可以执行若干次这样的操作：从可重集合中取出两个相等的数，把它们相加，然后插入到集合中，问：能否经过若干次操作使得集合中出现$2048$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are playing a variation of game 2048. Initially you have a multiset $ s $ of $ n $ integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two.
You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.
During each operation you choose two equal integers from $ s $ , remove them from $ s $ and insert the number equal to their sum into $ s $ .
For example, if $ s = \{1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2\} $ and you choose integers $ 2 $ and $ 2 $ , then the multiset becomes $ \{1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2\} $ .
You win if the number $ 2048 $ belongs to your multiset. For example, if $ s = \{1024, 512, 512, 4\} $ you can win as follows: choose $ 512 $ and $ 512 $ , your multiset turns into $ \{1024, 1024, 4\} $ . Then choose $ 1024 $ and $ 1024 $ , your multiset turns into $ \{2048, 4\} $ and you win.
You have to determine if you can win this game.
You have to answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 100 $ ) – the number of queries.
The first line of each query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of elements in multiset.
The second line of each query contains $ n $ integers $ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n $ ( $ 1 \le s_i \le 2^{29} $ ) — the description of the multiset. It is guaranteed that all elements of the multiset are powers of two.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print YES if it is possible to obtain the number $ 2048 $ in your multiset, and NO otherwise.
You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query you can win as follows: choose $ 512 $ and $ 512 $ , and $ s $ turns into $ \{1024, 64, 1024\} $ . Then choose $ 1024 $ and $ 1024 $ , and $ s $ turns into $ \{2048, 64\} $ and you win.
In the second query $ s $ contains $ 2048 $ initially.</div>
