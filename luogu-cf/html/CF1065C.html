<h1>Make It Equal</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个长度为$n$的序列。
定义切割操作为把序列中所有大于等于$H$（自定义）的数变为$H$，定义其代价为操作前后序列中所有数的变化量的和。
定义一个“好的”切割操作为代价小于等于K的操作。
问至少需要多少次“好的”切割操作才可以使序列中的所有数的大小均相等。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a toy building consisting of $ n $ towers. Each tower consists of several cubes standing on each other. The $ i $ -th tower consists of $ h_i $ cubes, so it has height $ h_i $ .
Let's define operation slice on some height $ H $ as following: for each tower $ i $ , if its height is greater than $ H $ , then remove some top cubes to make tower's height equal to $ H $ . Cost of one "slice" equals to the total number of removed cubes from all towers.
Let's name slice as good one if its cost is lower or equal to $ k $ ( $ k \ge n $ ).

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ n \le k \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of towers and the restriction on slices, respectively.
The second line contains $ n $ space separated integers $ h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n $ ( $ 1 \le h_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the initial heights of towers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same heigth.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it's optimal to make $ 2 $ slices. The first slice is on height $ 2 $ (its cost is $ 3 $ ), and the second one is on height $ 1 $ (its cost is $ 4 $ ).</div>
