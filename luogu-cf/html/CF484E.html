<h1>Sign on Fence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为n的数列，有m次询问，询问形如l r k
要你在区间[l,r]内选一个长度为k的区间，求区间最小数的最大值</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bizon the Champion has recently finished painting his wood fence. The fence consists of a sequence of $ n $ panels of $ 1 $ meter width and of arbitrary height. The $ i $ -th panel's height is $ h_{i} $ meters. The adjacent planks follow without a gap between them.
After Bizon painted the fence he decided to put a "for sale" sign on it. The sign will be drawn on a rectangular piece of paper and placed on the fence so that the sides of the sign are parallel to the fence panels and are also aligned with the edges of some panels. Bizon the Champion introduced the following constraints for the sign position:
1. The width of the sign should be exactly $ w $ meters.
2. The sign must fit into the segment of the fence from the $ l $ -th to the $ r $ -th panels, inclusive (also, it can't exceed the fence's bound in vertical direction).
The sign will be really pretty, So Bizon the Champion wants the sign's height to be as large as possible.
You are given the description of the fence and several queries for placing sign. For each query print the maximum possible height of the sign that can be placed on the corresponding segment of the fence with the given fixed width of the sign.
