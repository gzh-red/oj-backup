<h1>Megacity</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The administration of the Tomsk Region firmly believes that it's time to become a megacity (that is, get population of one million). Instead of improving the demographic situation, they decided to achieve its goal by expanding the boundaries of the city.
The city of Tomsk can be represented as point on the plane with coordinates ( $ 0 $ ; $ 0 $ ). The city is surrounded with $ n $ other locations, the $ i $ -th one has coordinates ( $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ ) with the population of $ k_{i} $ people. You can widen the city boundaries to a circle of radius $ r $ . In such case all locations inside the circle and on its border are included into the city.
Your goal is to write a program that will determine the minimum radius $ r $ , to which is necessary to expand the boundaries of Tomsk, so that it becomes a megacity.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ s $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ; $ 1<=s&lt;10^{6} $ ) — the number of locatons around Tomsk city and the population of the city. Then $ n $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th line contains three integers — the $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ coordinate values of the $ i $ -th location and the number $ k_{i} $ of people in it ( $ 1<=k_{i}&lt;10^{6} $ ). Each coordinate is an integer and doesn't exceed $ 10^{4} $ in its absolute value.
It is guaranteed that no two locations are at the same point and no location is at point ( $ 0; 0 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the output, print "-1" (without the quotes), if Tomsk won't be able to become a megacity. Otherwise, in the first line print a single real number — the minimum radius of the circle that the city needs to expand to in order to become a megacity.
The answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error don't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
