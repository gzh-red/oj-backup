<h1>Little Elephant and Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个长度为$n(2<=n<=10^5)$的序列，判断在一次交换（即交换序列中的两个数）后能否使它成为不下降序列。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Little Elephant has got a problem — somebody has been touching his sorted by non-decreasing array $ a $ of length $ n $ and possibly swapped some elements of the array.
The Little Elephant doesn't want to call the police until he understands if he could have accidentally changed the array himself. He thinks that he could have accidentally changed array $ a $ , only if array $ a $ can be sorted in no more than one operation of swapping elements (not necessarily adjacent). That is, the Little Elephant could have accidentally swapped some two elements.
Help the Little Elephant, determine if he could have accidentally changed the array $ a $ , sorted by non-decreasing, himself.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (2<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the size of array $ a $ . The next line contains $ n $ positive integers, separated by single spaces and not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ , — array $ a $ .
Note that the elements of the array are not necessarily distinct numbers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if the Little Elephant could have accidentally changed the array himself, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.</div>

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the array has already been sorted, so to sort it, we need 0 swap operations, that is not more than 1. Thus, the answer is "YES".
In the second sample we can sort the array if we swap elements 1 and 3, so we need 1 swap operation to sort the array. Thus, the answer is "YES".
In the third sample we can't sort the array in more than one swap operation, so the answer is "NO".</div>
