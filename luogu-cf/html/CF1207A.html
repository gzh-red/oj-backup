<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are two types of burgers in your restaurant — hamburgers and chicken burgers! To assemble a hamburger you need two buns and a beef patty. To assemble a chicken burger you need two buns and a chicken cutlet.
You have $ b $ buns, $ p $ beef patties and $ f $ chicken cutlets in your restaurant. You can sell one hamburger for $ h $ dollars and one chicken burger for $ c $ dollars. Calculate the maximum profit you can achieve.
You have to answer $ t $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) – the number of queries.
The first line of each query contains three integers $ b $ , $ p $ and $ f $ ( $ 1 \le b, ~p, ~f \le 100 $ ) — the number of buns, beef patties and chicken cutlets in your restaurant.
The second line of each query contains two integers $ h $ and $ c $ ( $ 1 \le h, ~c \le 100 $ ) — the hamburger and chicken burger prices in your restaurant.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print one integer — the maximum profit you can achieve.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first query you have to sell two hamburgers and three chicken burgers. Your income is $ 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 10 = 40 $ .
In second query you have to ell one hamburgers and two chicken burgers. Your income is $ 1 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot 12 = 34 $ .
In third query you can not create any type of burgers because because you have only one bun. So your income is zero.</div>
