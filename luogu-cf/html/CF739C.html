输出其长度。
输入：
第一行一个整数$n$，表示数的个数。
第二行$n$个整数$a_i$。
第三行一个整数$m$，表示操作个数。
下面$m$行，每行$3$个整数，$l_i,r_i,d_i$，表示将$l_i$到$r_i$的数字加$d_i$。
输出：
对于**每个**操作，输出操作完后的答案(见题意)。
样例解释：
1. 5 5 5 5 5 $\to$ 7 7 7 5 5 ，最长的是7 5，长度为2
2. 7 7 7 5 5 $\to$ 7 8 7 5 5 ，最长的是7 8 7 5 ，长度为4

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alyona has built $ n $ towers by putting small cubes some on the top of others. Each cube has size $ 1×1×1 $ . A tower is a non-zero amount of cubes standing on the top of each other. The towers are next to each other, forming a row.
Sometimes Alyona chooses some segment towers, and put on the top of each tower several cubes. Formally, Alyouna chooses some segment of towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ and adds $ d_{i} $ cubes on the top of them.
Let the sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ be the heights of the towers from left to right. Let's call as a segment of towers $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r} $ a hill if the following condition holds: there is integer $ k $ ( $ l<=k<=r $ ) such that $ a_{l}&lt;a_{l+1}&lt;a_{l+2}&lt;...&lt;a_{k}&gt;a_{k+1}&gt;a_{k+2}&gt;...&gt;a_{r} $ .
After each addition of $ d_{i} $ cubes on the top of the towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ , Alyona wants to know the maximum width among all hills. The width of a hill is the number of towers in it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contain single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of towers.
The second line contain $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of cubes in each tower.
The third line contain single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of additions.
The next $ m $ lines contain $ 3 $ integers each. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ and $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ , $ 1<=d_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), that mean that Alyona puts $ d_{i} $ cubes on the tio of each of the towers from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ lines. In $ i $ -th line print the maximum width of the hills after the $ i $ -th addition.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first sample is as follows:
After addition of $ 2 $ cubes on the top of each towers from the first to the third, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to $ [7,7,7,5,5] $ . The hill with maximum width is $ [7,5] $ , thus the maximum width is $ 2 $ .
After addition of $ 1 $ cube on the second tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to $ [7,8,7,5,5] $ . The hill with maximum width is now $ [7,8,7,5] $ , thus the maximum width is $ 4 $ .
After addition of $ 1 $ cube on the fourth tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to $ [7,8,7,6,5] $ . The hill with maximum width is now $ [7,8,7,6,5] $ , thus the maximum width is $ 5 $ .</div>
