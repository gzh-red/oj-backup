<h1>The Pleasant Walk</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$n$个房子，$k$种颜色。
每个房子有一种颜色。
现在想找到**最长连续**的一段区间，使得**相邻的房子颜色不同**。
输入：
第一行两个整数，$n,k$含义如上。
第二行$n$个整数，为每个房子的颜色。
输出：
仅有一个整数，为区间的长度。
样例解释：
房子的颜色依次为1 2 3 3 2 1 2 2，易知，最长区间为3 2 1 2，其长度为4。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ houses along the road where Anya lives, each one is painted in one of $ k $ possible colors.
Anya likes walking along this road, but she doesn't like when two adjacent houses at the road have the same color. She wants to select a long segment of the road such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
Help Anya find the longest segment with this property.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ — the number of houses and the number of colors ( $ 1 \le n \le 100\,000 $ , $ 1 \le k \le 100\,000 $ ).
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ — the colors of the houses along the road ( $ 1 \le a_i \le k $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the maximum number of houses on the road segment having no two adjacent houses of the same color.</div>
