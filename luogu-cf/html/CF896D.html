<h1>Nephren Runs a Cinema</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>No.68电影院没有50元零钱了.
有n名顾客排队购买电影票，一张电影票50元。顾客有三种，携带一张50元钞票的，携带一张100元钞票的(我们需要找给他一张50元)以及vip客户(不用付钱).
求有多少种排队的方法，使得当队伍里的人全部得到电影票时电影院工作人员手上的50元钞票在l-r之间(携带100元的顾客要得到找钱).只要队伍里有一名顾客的种类不同，这两个队伍就是不同的.输出结果模p.

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Lakhesh loves to make movies, so Nephren helps her run a cinema. We may call it No. 68 Cinema.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF896D/c4ab5c88eb89d5d2f9a45a0cad227d56ef890e10.png)
However, one day, the No. 68 Cinema runs out of changes (they don't have 50-yuan notes currently), but Nephren still wants to start their business. (Assume that yuan is a kind of currency in Regulu Ere.)
There are three types of customers: some of them bring exactly a 50-yuan note; some of them bring a 100-yuan note and Nephren needs to give a 50-yuan note back to him/her; some of them bring VIP cards so that they don't need to pay for the ticket.
Now $ n $ customers are waiting outside in queue. Nephren wants to know how many possible queues are there that they are able to run smoothly (i.e. every customer can receive his/her change), and that the number of 50-yuan notes they have after selling tickets to all these customers is between $ l $ and $ r $ , inclusive. Two queues are considered different if there exists a customer whose type is different in two queues. As the number can be large, please output the answer modulo $ p $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>One line containing four integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5}) $ , $ p $ ( $ 1<=p<=2·10^{9}) $ , $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 0<=l<=r<=n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>One line indicating the answer modulo $ p $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 97 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>13
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 100 0 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>35
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>We use A, B and C to indicate customers with 50-yuan notes, customers with 100-yuan notes and customers with VIP cards respectively.
For the first sample, the different possible queues that there are $ 2 $ 50-yuan notes left are AAAB, AABA, ABAA, AACC, ACAC, ACCA, CAAC, CACA and CCAA, and the different possible queues that there are $ 3 $ 50-yuan notes left are AAAC, AACA, ACAA and CAAA. So there are $ 13 $ different queues satisfying the first sample. Similarly, there are $ 35 $ different queues satisfying the second sample.</div>
