<h1>GCD Table</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一张$n\times m$ 的表，第$i$ 行第$j$ 列是$GCD(i,j)$
你有一个长度为$k$ 的数列$a$ ，询问是否存在$i,j$ ，满足对任意的$l$ ，均有$GCD(i,j+l-1)=a_l(1\leq l\leq k)$ 。
Translated by Fheiwn</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider a table $ G $ of size $ n×m $ such that $ G(i,j)=GCD(i,j) $ for all $ 1<=i<=n,1<=j<=m $ . $ GCD(a,b) $ is the greatest common divisor of numbers $ a $ and $ b $ .
You have a sequence of positive integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ . We say that this sequence occurs in table $ G $ if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers $ 1<=i<=n $ and $ 1<=j<=m-k+1 $ should exist that $ G(i,j+l-1)=a_{l} $ for all $ 1<=l<=k $ .
Determine if the sequence $ a $ occurs in table $ G $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{12} $ ; $ 1<=k<=10000 $ ). The second line contains $ k $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{12} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single word "YES", if the given sequence occurs in table $ G $ , otherwise print "NO".</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>100 100 5
5 2 1 2 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>100 8 5
5 2 1 2 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>100 100 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Sample 1. The tenth row of table $ G $ starts from sequence {1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 10}. As you can see, elements from fifth to ninth coincide with sequence $ a $ .
Sample 2. This time the width of table $ G $ equals 8. Sequence $ a $ doesn't occur there.</div>
