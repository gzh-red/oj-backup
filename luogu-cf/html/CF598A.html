<h1>Tricky Sum</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>简明题意：
该题目有多组数据，每组数据给出一个n，让你求出从1到n的和，但是其中每当遇到一个数是2的次幂时，就要变加为减。例如输入n=4，那么计算算式为-1-2+3-4=-4，因为1是2^0，2是2^1，4是2^2。共有t组数据。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum.
For example, for $ n=4 $ the sum is equal to $ -1-2+3-4=-4 $ , because $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ are $ 2^{0} $ , $ 2^{1} $ and $ 2^{2} $ respectively.
Calculate the answer for $ t $ values of $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=100 $ ) — the number of values of $ n $ to be processed.
Each of next $ t $ lines contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the requested sum for each of $ t $ integers $ n $ given in the input.</div>
