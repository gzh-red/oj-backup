<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
现在有n个海狮坐成一个圆圈玩♂游♂戏。所有海狮都被顺时针的被编上号码了：2号海狮在1号海狮的左边坐着，3号海狮在2号海狮的左边坐着，……，1号海狮在n号海狮的左边坐着。
我们还有一位慷慨的来自某薯片公司的员工。他为了宣传他的薯片有多好吃，带来了m片薯片来到海狮群做宣传。他站在海狮圈的中间并顺时针转动。第i号海狮可以分到i个薯片。如果这位员工没有足够的薯片，这个黑心的员工就带着剩下的薯片跑了。现在给你n和m，让你求这个员工最后会拿多少薯片。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
一行，包含两个整数n和m。（1<=n<=50，1<=m<=10^4）
### 输出格式
输出这个员工带着多少薯片跑了
感谢@deadpool123 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ walruses sitting in a circle. All of them are numbered in the clockwise order: the walrus number $ 2 $ sits to the left of the walrus number $ 1 $ , the walrus number $ 3 $ sits to the left of the walrus number $ 2 $ , ..., the walrus number $ 1 $ sits to the left of the walrus number $ n $ .
The presenter has $ m $ chips. The presenter stands in the middle of the circle and starts giving the chips to the walruses starting from walrus number $ 1 $ and moving clockwise. The walrus number $ i $ gets $ i $ chips. If the presenter can't give the current walrus the required number of chips, then the presenter takes the remaining chips and the process ends. Determine by the given $ n $ and $ m $ how many chips the presenter will get in the end.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=50 $ , $ 1<=m<=10^{4} $ ) — the number of walruses and the number of chips correspondingly.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of chips the presenter ended up with.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the presenter gives one chip to the walrus number $ 1 $ , two chips to the walrus number $ 2 $ , three chips to the walrus number $ 3 $ , four chips to the walrus number $ 4 $ , then again one chip to the walrus number $ 1 $ . After that the presenter runs out of chips. He can't give anything to the walrus number $ 2 $ and the process finishes.
In the third sample the presenter gives one chip to the walrus number $ 1 $ , two chips to the walrus number $ 2 $ , three chips to the walrus number $ 3 $ , then again one chip to the walrus number $ 1 $ . The presenter has one chip left and he can't give two chips to the walrus number $ 2 $ , that's why the presenter takes the last chip.</div>
