<h1>Magic Spheres</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Carl is a beginner magician. He has $ a $ blue, $ b $ violet and $ c $ orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least $ x $ blue, $ y $ violet and $ z $ orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 0<=a,b,c<=1000000 $ ) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that are in the magician's disposal.
The second line of the input contains three integers, $ x $ , $ y $ and $ z $ ( $ 0<=x,y,z<=1000000 $ ) — the number of blue, violet and orange spheres that he needs to get.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the wizard is able to obtain the required numbers of spheres, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the wizard has $ 4 $ blue and $ 4 $ violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have $ 2 $ blue and $ 5 $ violet spheres. Then he turns $ 4 $ violet spheres into $ 2 $ orange spheres and he ends up with $ 2 $ blue, $ 1 $ violet and $ 2 $ orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.</div>
