<h1>Concise and clear</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important — factorization of a number less than 1000000 is easier than of a number less than 1000000000. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of 1000000 you could write $ 10^{6} $ , instead of 1000000000 — $ 10^{9} $ , instead of 1000000007 — $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules:
- the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition ("+"), multiplication ("\*") and exponentiation ("^"), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden;
- the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing "2^3^4" is unacceptable;
- the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number;
- the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols.
Given $ n $ , find the equivalent concise notation for it.</div>
