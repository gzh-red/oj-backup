<h1>Game on Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>- 题目描述
给出一棵树，每次随机等概率选择一未染黑的点，将它及其子树染黑。问期望多少次操作可以将树全部染黑。
- 输入格式
第一行为一个整数$n$，描述这棵树有$n$个节点。
接下来$n-1$行，每行两个整数$a_i$和$b_i$，描述这个树的其中一条边的起点和终点的编号分别为$a_i$和$b_i$。
- 输出格式
输出一个实数，为描述的期望。
你的答案与标准答案若相差不超过$10^{-6}$，则你的答案就是正确的。
- 样例解释
在第一个示例中，有两个案例。
一个是直接删除根，另一个是在一个步骤后删除根。
因此，预期的步骤如下:
$1×(1/2)+2×(1/2)=1.5 $
在第二个样本中，情况变得更加复杂。有两种情况可以减少到第一个样本，一个案例立即被清理。
因此，预期的步骤如下:
$1×(1/3)+(1+1.5)×(2/3)=(1/3)+(5/3)=2$
- 数据规模与约定
保证 $1≤n≤10^5$。 $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n$ 且 $ a_{i}≠b_{i}$

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Momiji has got a rooted tree, consisting of $ n $ nodes. The tree nodes are numbered by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The root has number $ 1 $ . Momiji decided to play a game on this tree.
The game consists of several steps. On each step, Momiji chooses one of the remaining tree nodes (let's denote it by $ v $ ) and removes all the subtree nodes with the root in node $ v $ from the tree. Node $ v $ gets deleted as well. The game finishes when the tree has no nodes left. In other words, the game finishes after the step that chooses the node number $ 1 $ .
Each time Momiji chooses a new node uniformly among all the remaining nodes. Your task is to find the expectation of the number of steps in the described game.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of nodes in the tree. The next $ n-1 $ lines contain the tree edges. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n; a_{i}≠b_{i}) $ — the numbers of the nodes that are connected by the $ i $ -th edge.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single real number — the expectation of the number of steps in the described game.
The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are two cases. One is directly remove the root and another is remove the root after one step. Thus the expected steps are:
$ 1×(1/2)+2×(1/2)=1.5 $ In the second sample, things get more complex. There are two cases that reduce to the first sample, and one case cleaned at once. Thus the expected steps are:
$ 1×(1/3)+(1+1.5)×(2/3)=(1/3)+(5/3)=2 $</div>
