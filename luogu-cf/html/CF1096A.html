<h1>Find Divisible</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>每次给你一个范围 $[l,r]$ ，你需要找到一对整数 $(x,y)$ 使得 $y$ 能够被 $x$ 整除，保证有解，$T$ 组询问。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a range of positive integers from $ l $ to $ r $ .
Find such a pair of integers $ (x, y) $ that $ l \le x, y \le r $ , $ x \ne y $ and $ x $ divides $ y $ .
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
You are also asked to answer $ T $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \le T \le 1000 $ ) — the number of queries.
Each of the next $ T $ lines contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \le l \le r \le 998244353 $ ) — inclusive borders of the range.
It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries, which have at least one suitable pair.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ T $ lines, each line should contain the answer — two integers $ x $ and $ y $ such that $ l \le x, y \le r $ , $ x \ne y $ and $ x $ divides $ y $ . The answer in the $ i $ -th line should correspond to the $ i $ -th query from the input.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
