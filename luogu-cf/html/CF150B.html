<h1>Quantity of Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Just in case somebody missed it: this winter is totally cold in Nvodsk! It is so cold that one gets funny thoughts. For example, let's say there are strings with the length exactly $ n $ , based on the alphabet of size $ m $ . Any its substring with length equal to $ k $ is a palindrome. How many such strings exist? Your task is to find their quantity modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ). Be careful and don't miss a string or two!
Let us remind you that a string is a palindrome if it can be read the same way in either direction, from the left to the right and from the right to the left.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains three integers: $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=2000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of strings of the described type modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 1 1

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5 2 4

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample only one string is valid: "a" (let's denote the only letter of our alphabet as "a").
In the second sample (if we denote the alphabet letters as "a" and "b") the following strings are valid: "aaaaa" and "bbbbb".</div>
