<h1>Numbers on the blackboard</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n个数字，每次询问一个区间$ [l,r] $ ，对这个区间内部的点进行操作。
每次操作可以合并相邻两个数 $x$ , $y$ ，将它们变成 $ x+2y $ 对于每次询问输出当最后只剩下一个数字时，这个数字的最大值。
询问互相独立，答案对1e9+7取模。 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A sequence of $ n $ integers is written on a blackboard. Soon Sasha will come to the blackboard and start the following actions: let $ x $ and $ y $ be two adjacent numbers ( $ x $ before $ y $ ), then he can remove them and write $ x+2y $ instead of them. He will perform these operations until one number is left. Sasha likes big numbers and will get the biggest possible number.
Nikita wants to get to the blackboard before Sasha and erase some of the numbers. He has $ q $ options, in the option $ i $ he erases all numbers to the left of the $ l_{i} $ -th number and all numbers to the right of $ r_{i} $ -th number, i. e. all numbers between the $ l_{i} $ -th and the $ r_{i} $ -th, inclusive, remain on the blackboard. For each of the options he wants to know how big Sasha's final number is going to be. This number can be very big, so output it modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n,q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of integers on the blackboard and the number of Nikita's options.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the sequence on the blackboard.
Each of the next $ q $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ), describing Nikita's options.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each option output Sasha's result modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the second sample Nikita doesn't erase anything. Sasha first erases the numbers $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ and writes $ 5 $ . Then he erases $ 5 $ and -3 and gets -1. -1 modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ is $ 10^{9}+6 $ .</div>
