<h1>Bear and Forgotten Tree 2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A tree is a connected undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ n-1 $ edges. Vertices are numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ .
Limak is a little polar bear. He once had a tree with $ n $ vertices but he lost it. He still remembers something about the lost tree though.
You are given $ m $ pairs of vertices $ (a_{1},b_{1}),(a_{2},b_{2}),...,(a_{m},b_{m}) $ . Limak remembers that for each $ i $ there was no edge between $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ . He also remembers that vertex $ 1 $ was incident to exactly $ k $ edges (its degree was equal to $ k $ ).
Is it possible that Limak remembers everything correctly? Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF653E/c397b4548a4ab37dd7d160c3cf4973cb7d9aa698.png)) — the number of vertices in Limak's tree, the number of forbidden pairs of vertices, and the degree of vertex $ 1 $ , respectively.
The $ i $ -th of next $ m $ lines contains two distinct integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ) — the $ i $ -th pair that is forbidden. It's guaranteed that each pair of vertices will appear at most once in the input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "possible" (without quotes) if there exists at least one tree satisfying the given conditions. Otherwise, print "impossible" (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>impossible

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are $ n=5 $ vertices. The degree of vertex $ 1 $ should be $ k=2 $ . All conditions are satisfied for a tree with edges $ 1-5 $ , $ 5-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ and $ 3-4 $ .
In the second sample, Limak remembers that none of the following edges existed: $ 1-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ , $ 1-4 $ , $ 1-5 $ and $ 1-6 $ . Hence, vertex $ 1 $ couldn't be connected to any other vertex and it implies that there is no suitable tree.</div>
