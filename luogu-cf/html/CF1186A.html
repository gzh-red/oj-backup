<h1>Vus the Cossack and a Contest</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题意简述
Vus the Cossack举办了一场比赛。这场比赛有$n$个人参加。Vus the Cossack为他们准备了奖品——$m$只笔和$k$个笔记本。问是否每一个人都可以获得至少一支笔和一个笔记本。
## 输入格式
$n,m,k(1≤n,m,k≤100)$。
## 输出格式
如果每个人都可以获得至少一支笔和一个笔记本，请输出Yes，反之输出No。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vus the [Cossack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks) holds a programming competition, in which $ n $ people participate. He decided to award them all with pens and notebooks. It is known that Vus has exactly $ m $ pens and $ k $ notebooks.
Determine whether the Cossack can reward all participants, giving each of them at least one pen and at least one notebook.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , and $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq n, m, k \leq 100 $ ) — the number of participants, the number of pens, and the number of notebooks respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Yes" if it possible to reward all the participants. Otherwise, print "No".
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, there are $ 5 $ participants. The Cossack has $ 8 $ pens and $ 6 $ notebooks. Therefore, he has enough pens and notebooks.
In the second example, there are $ 3 $ participants. The Cossack has $ 9 $ pens and $ 3 $ notebooks. He has more than enough pens but only the minimum needed number of notebooks.
In the third example, there are $ 8 $ participants but only $ 5 $ pens. Since the Cossack does not have enough pens, the answer is "No".</div>
