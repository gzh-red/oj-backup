<h1>Bertown roads</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述：
贝尔顿小镇有n个交汇点和m条双向道路，一个人可以凭借现有的通道从一个点到达另一个点
随着城镇的车辆越来越多，交通堵塞逐渐成为大问题，为了解决这个问题，政府决定把所有的道路改成单向的，以此缓和交通问题
你的任务则是确定是否存在这样一种方案，使每条道路改为单向行驶，但仍满足能够从任意一个点到达另一任意点的要求，如果存在，则找出一种满足的方案
## 输入：
第一行包含两个整数表示n，m，接下来的m行，每行表示一条道路所连通的两个节点，数据确保可以从任意一个点到达另一个点
## 输出：
如果不存在满足的情况，则只输出0，
如果存在，输出应包含m行，每行包含两个整数pi和qi，表示道路改成由pi指向qi的单向通道
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bertown has $ n $ junctions and $ m $ bidirectional roads. We know that one can get from any junction to any other one by the existing roads.
As there were more and more cars in the city, traffic jams started to pose real problems. To deal with them the government decided to make the traffic one-directional on all the roads, thus easing down the traffic. Your task is to determine whether there is a way to make the traffic one-directional so that there still is the possibility to get from any junction to any other one. If the answer is positive, you should also find one of the possible ways to orient the roads.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},n-1<=m<=3·10^{5} $ ) which represent the number of junctions and the roads in the town correspondingly. Then follow $ m $ lines, each containing two numbers which describe the roads in the city. Each road is determined by two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ) — the numbers of junctions it connects.
It is guaranteed that one can get from any junction to any other one along the existing bidirectional roads. Each road connects different junctions, there is no more than one road between each pair of junctions.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there's no solution, print the single number $ 0 $ . Otherwise, print $ m $ lines each containing two integers $ p_{i} $ and $ q_{i} $ — each road's orientation. That is the traffic flow will move along a one-directional road from junction $ p_{i} $ to junction $ q_{i} $ . You can print the roads in any order. If there are several solutions to that problem, print any of them.</div>
