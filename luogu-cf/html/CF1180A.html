<h1>Alex and a Rhombus</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个整数$n$，你需要求出从$1\times 1$开始扩展$n-1$次的格子数量。
每一次扩展，所有与当前格子有边相邻的格子都会被扩展进答案里。比如$n\le 3$的情形如下面这张图：
![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1180A/ccf29660dcd8bd16597fff06e6153caa2bd347a9.png)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a $ n $ -th order rhombus in a cell grid.
A $ 1 $ -st order rhombus is just a square $ 1 \times 1 $ (i.e just a cell).
A $ n $ -th order rhombus for all $ n \geq 2 $ one obtains from a $ n-1 $ -th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1180A/ccf29660dcd8bd16597fff06e6153caa2bd347a9.png)Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a $ n $ -th order rhombus.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only input line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 100 $ ) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a $ n $ -th order rhombus.</div>
