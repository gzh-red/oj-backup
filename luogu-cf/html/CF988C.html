<h1>Equal Sums</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在n个长度不一定相同的序列中任选两个序列，两个序列都删去他们中的一个数，使得这两个序列的和相同</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ k $ sequences of integers. The length of the $ i $ -th sequence equals to $ n_i $ .
You have to choose exactly two sequences $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ i \ne j $ ) such that you can remove exactly one element in each of them in such a way that the sum of the changed sequence $ i $ (its length will be equal to $ n_i - 1 $ ) equals to the sum of the changed sequence $ j $ (its length will be equal to $ n_j - 1 $ ).
Note that it's required to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.
Assume that the sum of the empty (of the length equals $ 0 $ ) sequence is $ 0 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ k $ ( $ 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of sequences.
Then $ k $ pairs of lines follow, each pair containing a sequence.
The first line in the $ i $ -th pair contains one integer $ n_i $ ( $ 1 \le n_i < 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the length of the $ i $ -th sequence. The second line of the $ i $ -th pair contains a sequence of $ n_i $ integers $ a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \dots, a_{i, n_i} $ .
The elements of sequences are integer numbers from $ -10^4 $ to $ 10^4 $ .
The sum of lengths of all given sequences don't exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , i.e. $ n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to choose two sequences such that they satisfy given conditions, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), in the second line — two integers $ i $ , $ x $ ( $ 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le x \le n_i $ ), in the third line — two integers $ j $ , $ y $ ( $ 1 \le j \le k, 1 \le y \le n_j $ ). It means that the sum of the elements of the $ i $ -th sequence without the element with index $ x $ equals to the sum of the elements of the $ j $ -th sequence without the element with index $ y $ .
Two chosen sequences must be distinct, i.e. $ i \ne j $ . You can print them in any order.
If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example there are two sequences $ [2, 3, 1, 3, 2] $ and $ [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1] $ . You can remove the second element from the first sequence to get $ [2, 1, 3, 2] $ and you can remove the sixth element from the second sequence to get $ [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] $ . The sums of the both resulting sequences equal to $ 8 $ , i.e. the sums are equal.</div>
