<h1>LionAge II</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>珂朵莉给了你一个字符串$S$。她希望你改变其中的$k$个字符，使得整个字符串的**默契值**最高。
一个字符串的默契值定义为，对所有相邻的字符对$(x,y)$，在总和中加上$c(x,y)$后得到的值。$c(x,y)$会在输入里给出。
你只需要求出最高可能得到的**默契值**。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya plays the LionAge II. He was bored of playing with a stupid computer, so he installed this popular MMORPG, to fight with his friends. Vasya came up with the name of his character — non-empty string $ s $ , consisting of a lowercase Latin letters. However, in order not to put up a front of friends, Vasya has decided to change no more than $ k $ letters of the character name so that the new name sounded as good as possible. Euphony of the line is defined as follows: for each pair of adjacent letters $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ x $ immediately precedes $ y $ ) the bonus $ c(x,y) $ is added to the result. Your task is to determine what the greatest Euphony can be obtained by changing at most $ k $ letters in the name of the Vasya's character.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains character's name $ s $ and an integer number $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=100 $ ). The length of the nonempty string $ s $ does not exceed $ 100 $ . The second line contains an integer number $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=676 $ ) — amount of pairs of letters, giving bonus to the euphony. The next $ n $ lines contain description of these pairs « $ x $ $ y $ $ c $ », which means that sequence $ xy $ gives bonus $ c $ ( $ x,y $ — lowercase Latin letters, $ -1000<=c<=1000) $ . It is guaranteed that no pair $ x $ $ y $ mentioned twice in the input data.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the only number — maximum possible euphony оf the new character's name.</div>
