<h1>Kitahara Haruki&#039;s Gift</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div> Kitahara Haruki为 Touma Kazusa和 Ogiso Setsuna买了N个苹果。现在他想把所有的苹果分给两个朋友。
每个苹果重100克或200克。肯定啦，Kitahara Haruki不想冒犯任何一个朋友。因此，给Touma Kazusa与给Ogiso Setsuna的苹果的重量必须相等。
但是不幸的是，Kitahara Haruki现在没有刀，所以他不能把某个苹果切成几个部分。请你告诉他：有没有可能把所有的苹果平分给两个朋友？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kitahara Haruki has bought $ n $ apples for Touma Kazusa and Ogiso Setsuna. Now he wants to divide all the apples between the friends.
Each apple weights 100 grams or 200 grams. Of course Kitahara Haruki doesn't want to offend any of his friend. Therefore the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa must be equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna.
But unfortunately Kitahara Haruki doesn't have a knife right now, so he cannot split any apple into some parts. Please, tell him: is it possible to divide all the apples in a fair way between his friends?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=100) $ — the number of apples. The second line contains $ n $ integers $ w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{n} $ ( $ w_{i}=100 $ or $ w_{i}=200 $ ), where $ w_{i} $ is the weight of the $ i $ -th apple.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
