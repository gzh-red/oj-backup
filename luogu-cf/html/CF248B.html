<h1>Chilly Willy</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>willy对于数学十分感兴趣，他想知道在n位数中最小且可以被2，3，5，7整除的数，如果可以，请输出这个数，如果不行则输出-1。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chilly Willy loves playing with numbers. He only knows prime numbers that are digits yet. These numbers are $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 7 $ . But Willy grew rather bored of such numbers, so he came up with a few games that were connected with them.
Chilly Willy wants to find the minimum number of length $ n $ , such that it is simultaneously divisible by all numbers Willy already knows ( $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 7 $ ). Help him with that.
A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeros.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single input line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem without leading zeroes, or "-1" (without the quotes), if the number that meet the problem condition does not exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
