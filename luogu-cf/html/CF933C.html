<h1>A Colourful Prospect</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定至多三个圆，求这些圆将平面划分为了几个区域</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Firecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.
Little Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.
A wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3 $ ), denoting the number of circles.
The following $ n $ lines each contains three space-separated integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ ( $ -10<=x,y<=10 $ , $ 1<=r<=10 $ ), describing a circle whose center is $ (x,y) $ and the radius is $ r $ . No two circles have the same $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ at the same time.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of regions on the plane.</div>
