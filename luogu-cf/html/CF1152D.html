<h1>Neko and Aki&#039;s Prank</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个由所有长为2n的合法括号序列（即[P1241](https://www.luogu.org/problemnew/show/P1241)中的匹配，不过只有一种括号）组成的trie，现在要求这棵树上最多的边数，符合边两两之间均没有共同节点。输出这个值模1e9+7。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Neko is playing with his toys on the backyard of Aki's house. Aki decided to play a prank on him, by secretly putting catnip into Neko's toys. Unfortunately, he went overboard and put an entire bag of catnip into the toys...
It took Neko an entire day to turn back to normal. Neko reported to Aki that he saw a lot of weird things, including a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) of all correct bracket sequences of length $ 2n $ .
The definition of correct bracket sequence is as follows:
- The empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence,
- If $ s $ is a correct bracket sequence, then $ (\,s\,) $ is a correct bracket sequence,
- If $ s $ and $ t $ are a correct bracket sequence, then $ st $ is also a correct bracket sequence.
For example, the strings "(())", "()()" form a correct bracket sequence, while ")(" and "((" not.
Aki then came up with an interesting problem: What is the size of the maximum matching (the largest set of edges such that there are no two edges with a common vertex) in this trie? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly one integer — the size of the maximum matching in the trie. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .</div>
