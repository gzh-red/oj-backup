<h1>Restructuring Company</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$n$个人在公司里面工作。员工从$$1到$n$编号。每一个人属于一个部门。刚开始每一个人在自己的部门负责自己的项目，这样的话公司里面就有$n$个部门。
然而，公司内部出现了危机，需要合并一些部门，以提高工作效率。$team(person)$ 表示$person$这个人所在的部门。有以下两种合并操作：
1. 合并 $team(x)$ 和 $team(y)$。 $x$和$y$ ($1≤x,y≤n$)是员工编号。如果$team(x)$ 和 $team(y)$是同一个部门，那么就不操作。
2. 合并$team(x),team(x+1),...,team(y)$，$x$ 和 $y$ ($1≤x≤y≤n$)是员工编号。
有一些查询操作，查询员工$x$ 和 $y$ ($1≤x,y≤n$)是否属于同一部门。
$1\le n \le 200000 , 1\le q \le500000$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Even the most successful company can go through a crisis period when you have to make a hard decision — to restructure, discard and merge departments, fire employees and do other unpleasant stuff. Let's consider the following model of a company.
There are $ n $ people working for the Large Software Company. Each person belongs to some department. Initially, each person works on his own project in his own department (thus, each company initially consists of $ n $ departments, one person in each).
However, harsh times have come to the company and the management had to hire a crisis manager who would rebuild the working process in order to boost efficiency. Let's use $ team(person) $ to represent a team where person $ person $ works. A crisis manager can make decisions of two types:
1. Merge departments $ team(x) $ and $ team(y) $ into one large department containing all the employees of $ team(x) $ and $ team(y) $ , where $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ) — are numbers of two of some company employees. If $ team(x) $ matches $ team(y) $ , then nothing happens.
2. Merge departments $ team(x),team(x+1),...,team(y) $ , where $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x<=y<=n $ ) — the numbers of some two employees of the company.
At that the crisis manager can sometimes wonder whether employees $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ) work at the same department.
Help the crisis manager and answer all of his queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ , $ 1<=q<=500000 $ ) — the number of the employees of the company and the number of queries the crisis manager has.
Next $ q $ lines contain the queries of the crisis manager. Each query looks like $ type x y $ , where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF566D/ae4dda3b2c6ba5d113492306b1c249fd3378c442.png). If $ type=1 $ or $ type=2 $ , then the query represents the decision of a crisis manager about merging departments of the first and second types respectively. If $ type=3 $ , then your task is to determine whether employees $ x $ and $ y $ work at the same department. Note that $ x $ can be equal to $ y $ in the query of any type.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each question of type $ 3 $ print "YES" or "NO" (without the quotes), depending on whether the corresponding people work in the same department.</div>
