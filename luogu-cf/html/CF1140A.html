<h1>Detective Book</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小a喜欢看书。他在读一本书。每一页上有一个迷题，而这个谜题在ai（ai>=a）页会有答案。小a是个好奇心强的孩子，每天他只有读完今天所有的谜题的答案才会不睡觉。请问他要有几天看完这本书</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan recently bought a detective book. The book is so interesting that each page of this book introduces some sort of a mystery, which will be explained later. The $ i $ -th page contains some mystery that will be explained on page $ a_i $ ( $ a_i \ge i $ ).
Ivan wants to read the whole book. Each day, he reads the first page he didn't read earlier, and continues to read the following pages one by one, until all the mysteries he read about are explained and clear to him (Ivan stops if there does not exist any page $ i $ such that Ivan already has read it, but hasn't read page $ a_i $ ). After that, he closes the book and continues to read it on the following day from the next page.
How many days will it take to read the whole book?</div>
