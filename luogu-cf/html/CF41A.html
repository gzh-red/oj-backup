<h1>Translation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
Berland和Birland两地均有各自的语言，Berlandish和Birlandish.V是一个翻译员，负责将Berlandish翻译成Birlandish.将Berlandish翻译成Birlandish其实非常简单，只需把这个单词倒过来.比如单词code翻译过来就是edoc.但是粗心的V还是会犯一些错误。现在请你帮她判断一下他翻译的是否正确。
输入格式
两行，分别是一个Berlandish单词和V翻译的Birlandish单词。单词中所有字母均为小写拉丁字母（其实就是英文字母）;单词长度均不超过100字符，单词中不包含任何多余空格。
输出
一行，如果V的翻译是正确的，输出YES。否则输出NO
Translated by @FCBM71</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a berlandish word differs from a birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely. For example, a Berlandish word code corresponds to a Birlandish word edoc. However, it's easy to make a mistake during the «translation». Vasya translated word $ s $ from Berlandish into Birlandish as $ t $ . Help him: find out if he translated the word correctly.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains word $ s $ , the second line contains word $ t $ . The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. The input data do not consist unnecessary spaces. The words are not empty and their lengths do not exceed 100 symbols.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the word $ t $ is a word $ s $ , written reversely, print YES, otherwise print NO.</div>
