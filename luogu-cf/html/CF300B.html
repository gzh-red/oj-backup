<h1>Coach</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个教练有n名学生，n能被三整除。他想要将学生们分成三人一组去打ACM。学生们有m条要求，形如学生i和学生j想要分到同一组。
求一种满足所有要求的方案，如果不存在，输出-1。
输出格式：输出$\frac{n}{3} $行，每行三个数表示这一组的学生。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A programming coach has $ n $ students to teach. We know that $ n $ is divisible by $ 3 $ . Let's assume that all students are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , inclusive.
Before the university programming championship the coach wants to split all students into groups of three. For some pairs of students we know that they want to be on the same team. Besides, if the $ i $ -th student wants to be on the same team with the $ j $ -th one, then the $ j $ -th student wants to be on the same team with the $ i $ -th one. The coach wants the teams to show good results, so he wants the following condition to hold: if the $ i $ -th student wants to be on the same team with the $ j $ -th, then the $ i $ -th and the $ j $ -th students must be on the same team. Also, it is obvious that each student must be on exactly one team.
Help the coach and divide the teams the way he wants.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (3<=n<=48 $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300B/8bec3006093a3f5215392b39e9b150d4fab95186.png). Then follow $ m $ lines, each contains a pair of integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<b_{i}<=n) $ — the pair $ a_{i},b_{i} $ means that students with numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ want to be on the same team. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is divisible by $ 3 $ . It is guaranteed that each pair $ a_{i},b_{i} $ occurs in the input at most once.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the required division into teams doesn't exist, print number -1. Otherwise, print ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300B/cf2733ea0aacbe28f053605e4a0603ddeb7a4835.png) lines. In each line print three integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ , $ z_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}<=n $ ) — the $ i $ -th team.
If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
