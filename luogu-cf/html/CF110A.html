<h1>Nearly Lucky Number</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目要求
如果一个数仅包含4和7，那么它就是一个"幸运数字"。
如果一个数**本身不是**幸运数，但是它所含有的数字4和7的个数之和为一个"幸运数字"，那么它就是一个"类幸运数字"。
给您一个数，请编程判断它是不是"类幸运数字"。
### 输入格式
一行一个整数N(N在64位整数(long long / int64)范围内)。
### 输出格式
一行一个字符串，如果N是"类幸运数字"则输出"YES"，否则输出"NO"。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Unfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number $ n $ is a nearly lucky number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{18} $ ).
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print on the single line "YES" if $ n $ is a nearly lucky number. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>40047
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample there are 3 lucky digits (first one and last two), so the answer is "NO".
In the second sample there are 7 lucky digits, 7 is lucky number, so the answer is "YES".
In the third sample there are no lucky digits, so the answer is "NO".</div>
