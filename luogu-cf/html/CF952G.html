<h1>Puzzling Language</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem you will write a simple code generator for a 2D programming language derived from [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
The code in this language is a rectangular grid of characters '.' and 'X'. The code is converted to a Brainfuck program as follows: the characters are read in the usual order (top to bottom, left to right), and each 'X' character is converted a Brainfuck instruction to be executed. The instruction is defined by the left, top and right neighbors of the 'X' character using the following conversion table:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF952G/de5a0c0bfa2fbc80e44dad1d8d7c9310dc043297.png)You are given a string. Output a program in the described language which prints this string.
You can download the language interpreter used for judging here: <https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/952/puzzling-interpreter.cpp> (use C++11 to compile the code). Note several implementation details:
- The first step of the language interpretation is conversion to a Brainfuck program, which is then executed.
- The code must be rectangular, with all lines of the same length. It can have at most 10,000 lines and 10,000 columns, and can have at most 500,000 'X' characters.
- The code has toroidal topology, i.e. the 'X' on the first line will have top neighbor in the last line.
- Brainfuck interpreter has 30000 memory cells which store integers from 0 to 255 with increment/decrement done modulo 256.
- Console input (, command) is allowed in Brainfuck code but has no effect when executed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of a single string of characters with ASCII codes between 33 ('!') and 122 ('z'), inclusive. The length of the string is between 1 and 10 characters, inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a program in the described language which, when executed, will print the given message.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>$$$</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>.......X.......
......XXX......
.....XXXXX.....
....XXXXXXX....
...XXXXXXXXX...
..XXXXXXXXXXX..
.XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
...............
X.............X
X..............
X..............
X..............
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The example corresponds to the following Brainfuck program:
` -<br></br> >+<<br></br> >+++<<br></br> >+++++<<br></br> >+++++++<<br></br> >+++++++++<<br></br> >+++++++++++<<br></br><br></br>< ><br></br>.<br></br>.<br></br>.<br></br>`The triangular block decrements the first memory cell and sets the value of the second memory cell to 36 - the ASCII code of '$' character. The next line after the triangular block moves the memory pointer to the second memory cell, and the next three lines print the '$' character three times.</div>
