<h1>Flea travel</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个虫子位于绕城一圈的$n$片树叶中的一片上，在第$k$分钟，虫子会跳过$k-1$片树叶并在脚下的树叶上做一个记号。在这里，我们假设虫子的$life=+∞$。你的任务是判断该虫子是否将$n$片树叶都做了记号。
输入格式：
只有一行，一个数字$n$，为树叶总数量。
输出格式：
若将$n$片树叶都做了记号，输出$YES$。否则，输出$NO$。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A flea is sitting at one of the $ n $ hassocks, arranged in a circle, at the moment. After minute number $ k $ the flea jumps through $ k-1 $ hassoсks (clockwise). For example, after the first minute the flea jumps to the neighboring hassock. You should answer: will the flea visit all the hassocks or not. We assume that flea has infinitely much time for this jumping.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains single integer: $ 1<=n<=1000 $ — number of hassocks.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
