<h1>Ladies&#039; Shop</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$n$ 个不同的数$a_1,\ldots,a_n$ 现在要求从这$n$ 个数中选出最少的数字,使得其满足每一个$a_i$ 都可以通过从中选取任意数字(每种数字可以选任意个)组成,且从中取任意数字,只要其和不超过$m$ ,那么其和必然在之前的$n$ 个数里出现过</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A ladies' shop has recently opened in the city of Ultima Thule. To get ready for the opening, the shop bought $ n $ bags. Each bag is characterised by the total weight $ a_{i} $ of the items you can put there. The weird thing is, you cannot use these bags to put a set of items with the total weight strictly less than $ a_{i} $ . However the weights of the items that will be sold in the shop haven't yet been defined. That's what you should determine right now.
Your task is to find the set of the items' weights $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ $ (1<=p_{1}<p_{2}<...<p_{k}) $ , such that: 1. Any bag will be used. That is, for any $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ there will be such set of items that their total weight will equal $ a_{i} $ . We assume that there is the infinite number of items of any weight. You can put multiple items of the same weight in one bag. 2. For any set of items that have total weight less than or equal to $ m $ , there is a bag into which you can put this set. Similarly, a set of items can contain multiple items of the same weight. 3. Of all sets of the items' weights that satisfy points 1 and 2, find the set with the minimum number of weights. In other words, value $ k $ should be as small as possible.

Find and print the required set.</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first line contains space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{6} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ distinct space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{1}<a_{2}<...<a_{n}<=m $ ) — the bags' weight limits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print "NO" (without the quotes) if there isn't set $ p_{i} $ , that would meet the conditions.
Otherwise, in the first line print "YES" (without the quotes), in the second line print an integer $ k $ (showing how many numbers are in the suitable set with the minimum number of weights), in the third line print $ k $ space-separated integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ $ (1<=p_{1}<p_{2}<...<p_{k}) $ . If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</div>
