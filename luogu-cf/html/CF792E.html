<h1>Colored Balls</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>将n个数分解成若干组，如4 = 2+2， 7 = 2+2+3，保证所有组中数字之差<=1。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ boxes with colored balls on the table. Colors are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . $ i $ -th box contains $ a_{i} $ balls, all of which have color $ i $ . You have to write a program that will divide all balls into sets such that:
- each ball belongs to exactly one of the sets,
- there are no empty sets,
- there is no set containing two (or more) balls of different colors (each set contains only balls of one color),
- there are no two sets such that the difference between their sizes is greater than $ 1 $ .
Print the minimum possible number of sets.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=500 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...\ ,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer number — the minimum possible number of sets.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the balls can be divided into sets like that: one set with $ 4 $ balls of the first color, two sets with $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ balls, respectively, of the second color, and two sets with $ 4 $ balls of the third color.</div>
