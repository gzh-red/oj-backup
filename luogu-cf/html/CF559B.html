<h1>Equivalent Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定两个字符串$a,b$，询问它们是不是等价的（$Equivalent$，等效的，等价的）。
关于等价的定义：（以字符串$s$为例）
1. 如果$|s|$为奇数，那与$s$等价的字符串为它本身；
2. 如果$|s|$为偶数，那把$s$平分为两份，记作$s_{1},s_{2}$，与$s$等价的字符串为$s_{1}s_{2}$或$s_{2}s_{1}$
$|s|≤200000$
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings $ a $ and $ b $ of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:
1. They are equal.
2. If we split string $ a $ into two halves of the same size $ a_{1} $ and $ a_{2} $ , and string $ b $ into two halves of the same size $ b_{1} $ and $ b_{2} $ , then one of the following is correct:
1. $ a_{1} $ is equivalent to $ b_{1} $ , and $ a_{2} $ is equivalent to $ b_{2} $
2. $ a_{1} $ is equivalent to $ b_{2} $ , and $ a_{2} $ is equivalent to $ b_{1} $
As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.
Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from $ 1 $ to $ 200000 $ and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>aaba
abaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>aabb
abab
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one — into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".
In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".</div>
