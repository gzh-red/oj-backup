<h1>Multicolored Marbles</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarpus plays with red and blue marbles. He put $ n $ marbles from the left to the right in a row. As it turned out, the marbles form a zebroid.
A non-empty sequence of red and blue marbles is a zebroid, if the colors of the marbles in this sequence alternate. For example, sequences (red; blue; red) and (blue) are zebroids and sequence (red; red) is not a zebroid.
Now Polycarpus wonders, how many ways there are to pick a zebroid subsequence from this sequence. Help him solve the problem, find the number of ways modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{6}) $ — the number of marbles in Polycarpus's sequence.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Let's consider the first test sample. Let's assume that Polycarpus initially had sequence (red; blue; red), so there are six ways to pick a zebroid:
- pick the first marble;
- pick the second marble;
- pick the third marble;
- pick the first and second marbles;
- pick the second and third marbles;
- pick the first, second and third marbles.
It can be proven that if Polycarpus picks (blue; red; blue) as the initial sequence, the number of ways won't change.</div>
