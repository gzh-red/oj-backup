<h1>Expecting Trouble</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is Friday the 13th today, and even though you're a modern well-educated person, you can't help feeling a bit nervous about it. You decide to look for evidence against this superstition (or for it). As a first step, you recall all Fridays the 13th in your life and calculate how many of them were unusually bad — like that time when you decided to play a game on ZX Spectrum and ended up breaking your TV set. The problem is, you can't remember some Fridays, and you're not sure why — were they really that bad?
You have assembled a sequence of your recollections. Character "0" stands for a normal day, "1" — for a nasty one, and "?" means you have no idea what kind of day that was. Being a programmer, you decide to approximate these unknown days with independent random variables, which take value $ 1 $ with probability $ p $ , and $ 0 $ with probability $ (1-p) $ .
Given a string of your memories and the value of $ p $ , calculate out the expected value of average badness of your Fridays the 13th.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a string $ s $ which represents your Fridays; $ s $ will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive. Each character of $ s $ will be "0", "1" or "?".
The second line of the input contains a double $ p $ $ (0<=p<=1) $ . Double $ p $ is given with at most 2 digits after the decimal point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the expected value of average badness of your Fridays with exactly 5 decimal places. Please, use standard mathematical rules when you are rounding an answer.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0.37500

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case, you're doomed. DOOMED! Sorry, just had to say that.</div>
