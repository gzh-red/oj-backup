<h1>King Moves</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>这里只有一个国王在国际象棋的棋盘上。
你会知道这个国王的坐标 $cd$ ：其中 $c$ 是行，用字母 $a$ 到 $h$ 表示， $d$ 是列，用数字 $1$ 到 $8$ 表示。
现在，你需要求的是，这个国王可以移动到几个格子上。
例如：![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF710A/c293477e407dd29c222477fd35652e45e6890a3c.png)
图片中的国王位于 $e4$ ，他可以移动到 $8$ 个位置。
Translated by @dblark</div>
