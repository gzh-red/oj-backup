<h1>New Building for SIS</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are looking at the floor plan of the Summer Informatics School's new building. You were tasked with SIS logistics, so you really care about travel time between different locations: it is important to know how long it would take to get from the lecture room to the canteen, or from the gym to the server room.
The building consists of $ n $ towers, $ h $ floors each, where the towers are labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the floors are labeled from $ 1 $ to $ h $ . There is a passage between any two adjacent towers (two towers $ i $ and $ i+1 $ for all $ i $ : $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ) on every floor $ x $ , where $ a<=x<=b $ . It takes exactly one minute to walk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two adjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not permitted to leave the building.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1020A/f837e8e8bdf323146303fdec0eaae175f05c2066.png)The picture illustrates the first example.
You have given $ k $ pairs of locations $ (t_{a},f_{a}) $ , $ (t_{b},f_{b}) $ : floor $ f_{a} $ of tower $ t_{a} $ and floor $ f_{b} $ of tower $ t_{b} $ . For each pair you need to determine the minimum walking time between these locations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains following integers:
- $ n $ : the number of towers in the building ( $ 1<=n<=10^{8} $ ),
- $ h $ : the number of floors in each tower ( $ 1<=h<=10^{8} $ ),
- $ a $ and $ b $ : the lowest and highest floor where it's possible to move between adjacent towers ( $ 1<=a<=b<=h $ ),
- $ k $ : total number of queries ( $ 1<=k<=10^{4} $ ).
Next $ k $ lines contain description of the queries. Each description consists of four integers $ t_{a} $ , $ f_{a} $ , $ t_{b} $ , $ f_{b} $ ( $ 1<=t_{a},t_{b}<=n $ , $ 1<=f_{a},f_{b}<=h $ ). This corresponds to a query to find the minimum travel time between $ f_{a} $ -th floor of the $ t_{a} $ -th tower and $ f_{b} $ -th floor of the $ t_{b} $ -th tower.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print a single integer: the minimum walking time between the locations in minutes.</div>
