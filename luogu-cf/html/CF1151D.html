<h1>Stas and the Queue at the Buffet</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>共有$n$个人
第$i$个人有属性值$a_i,b_i$
现在要给这$n$个人重排顺序，设第$i$个人站在位置$j$，则他的不满意度是$a_i \times (j-1) + b_i \times (n-j)$
最小化所有人的不满意度之和，求这个最小值</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>During a break in the buffet of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, there was formed a queue of $ n $ high school students numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Initially, each student $ i $ is on position $ i $ . Each student $ i $ is characterized by two numbers — $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ . Dissatisfaction of the person $ i $ equals the product of $ a_i $ by the number of people standing to the left of his position, add the product $ b_i $ by the number of people standing to the right of his position. Formally, the dissatisfaction of the student $ i $ , which is on the position $ j $ , equals $ a_i \cdot (j-1) + b_i \cdot (n-j) $ .
The director entrusted Stas with the task: rearrange the people in the queue so that minimize the total dissatisfaction.
Although Stas is able to solve such problems, this was not given to him. He turned for help to you.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ ) — the number of people in the queue.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^8 $ ) — the characteristic of the student $ i $ , initially on the position $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer — minimum total dissatisfaction which can be achieved by rearranging people in the queue.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it is optimal to put people in this order: ( $ 3, 1, 2 $ ). The first person is in the position of $ 2 $ , then his dissatisfaction will be equal to $ 4 \cdot 1+2 \cdot 1=6 $ . The second person is in the position of $ 3 $ , his dissatisfaction will be equal to $ 2 \cdot 2+3 \cdot 0=4 $ . The third person is in the position of $ 1 $ , his dissatisfaction will be equal to $ 6 \cdot 0+1 \cdot 2=2 $ . The total dissatisfaction will be $ 12 $ .
In the second example, you need to put people in this order: ( $ 3, 2, 4, 1 $ ). The total dissatisfaction will be $ 25 $ .</div>
