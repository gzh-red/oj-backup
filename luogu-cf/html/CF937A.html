<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：

输入格式：
第一行：一个n，接下来的一行里有n个数。
输出格式：

感谢 @（T_T） 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The recent All-Berland Olympiad in Informatics featured $ n $ participants with each scoring a certain amount of points.
As the head of the programming committee, you are to determine the set of participants to be awarded with diplomas with respect to the following criteria:
- At least one participant should get a diploma.
- None of those with score equal to zero should get awarded.
- When someone is awarded, all participants with score not less than his score should also be awarded.
Determine the number of ways to choose a subset of participants that will receive the diplomas.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of participants.
The next line contains a sequence of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=600 $ ) — participants' scores.
It's guaranteed that at least one participant has non-zero score.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the desired number of ways.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There are three ways to choose a subset in sample case one.
1. Only participants with 3 points will get diplomas.
2. Participants with 2 or 3 points will get diplomas.
3. Everyone will get a diploma!
The only option in sample case two is to award everyone.
Note that in sample case three participants with zero scores cannot get anything.</div>
