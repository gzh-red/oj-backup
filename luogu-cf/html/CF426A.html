<h1>Sereja and Mugs</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题意
给定$n$个数和$s$，求其中最小的$n-1$个数加起来是否超过$s$
## 输入格式
第一行两个正整数$n$和$k$。
接下来一行$n$个整数表示这$n$个数字。
## 输出格式
如果不超过$s$，则输出```YES```，反之输出```NO```。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja showed an interesting game to his friends. The game goes like that. Initially, there is a table with an empty cup and $ n $ water mugs on it. Then all players take turns to move. During a move, a player takes a non-empty mug of water and pours all water from it into the cup. If the cup overfills, then we assume that this player lost.
As soon as Sereja's friends heard of the game, they wanted to play it. Sereja, on the other hand, wanted to find out whether his friends can play the game in such a way that there are no losers. You are given the volumes of all mugs and the cup. Also, you know that Sereja has $ (n-1) $ friends. Determine if Sereja's friends can play the game so that nobody loses.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ s $ $ (2<=n<=100; 1<=s<=1000) $ — the number of mugs and the volume of the cup. The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10) $ . Number $ a_{i} $ means the volume of the $ i $ -th mug.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line, print "YES" (without the quotes) if his friends can play in the described manner, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.</div>
