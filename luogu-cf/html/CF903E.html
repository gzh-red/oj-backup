<h1>Swapping Characters</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We had a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters. We made $ k $ copies of this string, thus obtaining $ k $ identical strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ . After that, in each of these strings we swapped exactly two characters (the characters we swapped could be identical, but they had different indices in the string).
You are given $ k $ strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , and you have to restore any string $ s $ so that it is possible to obtain these strings by performing aforementioned operations. Note that the total length of the strings you are given doesn't exceed 5000 (that is, $ k·n<=5000 $ ).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ k $ and $ n $ ( $ 1<=k<=2500,2<=n<=5000,k · n<=5000 $ ) — the number of strings we obtained, and the length of each of these strings.
Next $ k $ lines contain the strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , each consisting of exactly $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print any suitable string $ s $ , or -1 if such string doesn't exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 4

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example $ s_{1} $ is obtained by swapping the second and the fourth character in acab, $ s_{2} $ is obtained by swapping the first and the second character, and to get $ s_{3} $ , we swap the third and the fourth character.
In the second example $ s_{1} $ is obtained by swapping the third and the fourth character in kbub, $ s_{2} $ — by swapping the second and the fourth, and $ s_{3} $ — by swapping the first and the third.
In the third example it's impossible to obtain given strings by aforementioned operations.</div>
