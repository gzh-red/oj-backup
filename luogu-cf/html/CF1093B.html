<h1>Letters Rearranging</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$t$ 组询问，每次给你一个字符串，将其重新排列使其成为一个非回文串，如果无解则输出 `-1` 。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
You can rearrange all letters of this string as you wish. Your task is to obtain a good string by rearranging the letters of the given string or report that it is impossible to do it.
Let's call a string good if it is not a palindrome. Palindrome is a string which is read from left to right the same as from right to left. For example, strings "abacaba", "aa" and "z" are palindromes and strings "bba", "xd" are not.
You have to answer $ t $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) — number of queries.
Each of the next $ t $ lines contains one string. The $ i $ -th line contains a string $ s_i $ consisting only of lowercase Latin letter. It is guaranteed that the length of $ s_i $ is from $ 1 $ to $ 1000 $ (inclusive).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ t $ lines. In the $ i $ -th line print the answer to the $ i $ -th query: -1 if it is impossible to obtain a good string by rearranging the letters of $ s_i $ and any good string which can be obtained from the given one (by rearranging the letters) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
3
aa
abacaba
xdd
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
-1
abaacba
xdd</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query we cannot rearrange letters to obtain a good string.
Other examples (not all) of correct answers to the second query: "ababaca", "abcabaa", "baacaba".
In the third query we can do nothing to obtain a good string.</div>
