<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出两个整数n，m，a数组有n个数，b数组有m个数。求一个数，这个数的每一位必须在a数组和b数组中至少出现过一次，求符合条件的数当中最小的数。
Translated by @我是lyy</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two lists of non-zero digits.
Let's call an integer pretty if its (base $ 10 $ ) representation has at least one digit from the first list and at least one digit from the second list. What is the smallest positive pretty integer?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=9 $ ) — the lengths of the first and the second lists, respectively.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct digits $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=9 $ ) — the elements of the first list.
The third line contains $ m $ distinct digits $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=9 $ ) — the elements of the second list.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the smallest pretty integer.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example $ 25 $ , $ 46 $ , $ 24567 $ are pretty, as well as many other integers. The smallest among them is $ 25 $ . $ 42 $ and $ 24 $ are not pretty because they don't have digits from the second list.
In the second example all integers that have at least one digit different from $ 9 $ are pretty. It's obvious that the smallest among them is $ 1 $ , because it's the smallest positive integer.</div>
