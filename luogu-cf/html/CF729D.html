<h1>Sea Battle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有 $n$ 个格子, 在里面含有 $a$ 条船, 每条船占 $b$ 个格子, 但并不知道船的位置. Galya对这些格子射击过 $k$ 次,但遗憾的是并没有射击到船,
现在给出长度为 $n$ 的字符串, 其中 $0$ 表示未知的格子, $1$ 表示已经被射击过确认没有船的格子, 问要至少射中一条船, 需要再射击多少次, 并输出这些位置的编号.
感谢@凌幽 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Galya is playing one-dimensional Sea Battle on a $ 1×n $ grid. In this game $ a $ ships are placed on the grid. Each of the ships consists of $ b $ consecutive cells. No cell can be part of two ships, however, the ships can touch each other.
Galya doesn't know the ships location. She can shoot to some cells and after each shot she is told if that cell was a part of some ship (this case is called "hit") or not (this case is called "miss").
Galya has already made $ k $ shots, all of them were misses.
Your task is to calculate the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.
It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid ships placement.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four positive integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ , $ 1<=a,b<=n $ , $ 0<=k<=n-1 $ ) — the length of the grid, the number of ships on the grid, the length of each ship and the number of shots Galya has already made.
The second line contains a string of length $ n $ , consisting of zeros and ones. If the $ i $ -th character is one, Galya has already made a shot to this cell. Otherwise, she hasn't. It is guaranteed that there are exactly $ k $ ones in this string.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the minimum number of cells such that if Galya shoot at all of them, she would hit at least one ship.
In the second line print the cells Galya should shoot at.
Each cell should be printed exactly once. You can print the cells in arbitrary order. The cells are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , starting from the left.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There is one ship in the first sample. It can be either to the left or to the right from the shot Galya has already made (the "1" character). So, it is necessary to make two shots: one at the left part, and one at the right part.</div>
