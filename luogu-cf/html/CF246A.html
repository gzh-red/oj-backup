<h1>Buggy Sorting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little boy Valera studies an algorithm of sorting an integer array. After studying the theory, he went on to the practical tasks. As a result, he wrote a program that sorts an array of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ in the non-decreasing order. The pseudocode of the program, written by Valera, is given below. The input of the program gets number $ n $ and array $ a $ .
`<br></br>loop integer variable $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ <br></br>    loop integer variable $ j $ from $ i $ to $ n-1 $ <br></br>        if $ (a_{j}&gt;a_{j+1}) $ , then swap the values of elements $ a_{j} $ and $ a_{j+1} $ <br></br>`But Valera could have made a mistake, because he hasn't yet fully learned the sorting algorithm. If Valera made a mistake in his program, you need to give a counter-example that makes his program work improperly (that is, the example that makes the program sort the array not in the non-decreasing order). If such example for the given value of $ n $ doesn't exist, print -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You've got a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=50) $ — the size of the sorted array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=100 $ ) — the counter-example, for which Valera's algorithm won't work correctly. If the counter-example that meets the described conditions is impossible to give, print -1.
If there are several counter-examples, consisting of $ n $ numbers, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
