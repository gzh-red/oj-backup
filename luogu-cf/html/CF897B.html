<h1>Chtholly&#039;s request</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>如果一个数字在十进制下没有前导零、长度为偶数且是一个回文数，那么它是一个zcy数
例如12321和1221是回文数，123和12451不是。 而且，1221是zcy数，12321不是。
给出整数k , p ，计算出前k小的zcy数的和并输出其模 p 后的结果
Translated by @保登心爱 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> — Thanks a lot for today.— I experienced so many great things.
— You gave me memories like dreams... But I have to leave now...
— One last request, can you...
— Help me solve a Codeforces problem?
— ......
— What?
Chtholly has been thinking about a problem for days:
If a number is palindrome and length of its decimal representation without leading zeros is even, we call it a zcy number. A number is palindrome means when written in decimal representation, it contains no leading zeros and reads the same forwards and backwards. For example 12321 and 1221 are palindromes and 123 and 12451 are not. Moreover, 1221 is zcy number and 12321 is not.
Given integers $ k $ and $ p $ , calculate the sum of the $ k $ smallest zcy numbers and output this sum modulo $ p $ .
Unfortunately, Willem isn't good at solving this kind of problems, so he asks you for help!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ k $ and $ p $ $ (1<=k<=10^{5},1<=p<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output single integer — answer to the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the smallest zcy number is $ 11 $ , and the second smallest zcy number is $ 22 $ .
In the second example, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF897B/8301f23cf6a6ac38a43acd044c106b422734f787.png).</div>
