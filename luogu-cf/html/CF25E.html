<h1>Test</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定3个字符串s1,s2,s3,试求一个字符串，使s1,s2,s3都是这个字符串的子串，并使这个字符串最短。输出最短字符串的长度l。
s1,s2,s3长度<=100000

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sometimes it is hard to prepare tests for programming problems. Now Bob is preparing tests to new problem about strings — input data to his problem is one string. Bob has 3 wrong solutions to this problem. The first gives the wrong answer if the input data contains the substring $ s_{1} $ , the second enters an infinite loop if the input data contains the substring $ s_{2} $ , and the third requires too much memory if the input data contains the substring $ s_{3} $ . Bob wants these solutions to fail single test. What is the minimal length of test, which couldn't be passed by all three Bob's solutions?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are exactly 3 lines in the input data. The $ i $ -th line contains string $ s_{i} $ . All the strings are non-empty, consists of lowercase Latin letters, the length of each string doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one number — what is minimal length of the string, containing $ s_{1} $ , $ s_{2} $ and $ s_{3} $ as substrings.</div>
