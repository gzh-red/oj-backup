<h1>Cool Slogans</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个长度为n的字符串s[1]，由小写字母组成。定义一个字符串序列s[1....k],满足性质：s[i]在s[i-1] (i>=2)中出现至少两次（位置可重叠），问最大的k是多少，使得从s[1]开始到s[k]都满足这样一个性质。
感谢@fanfan 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bomboslav set up a branding agency and now helps companies to create new logos and advertising slogans. In term of this problems, slogan of the company should be a non-empty substring of its name. For example, if the company name is "hornsandhoofs", then substrings "sand" and "hor" could be its slogans, while strings "e" and "hornss" can not.
Sometimes the company performs rebranding and changes its slogan. Slogan $ A $ is considered to be cooler than slogan $ B $ if $ B $ appears in $ A $ as a substring at least twice (this occurrences are allowed to overlap). For example, slogan $ A= $ "abacaba" is cooler than slogan $ B= $ "ba", slogan $ A= $ "abcbcbe" is cooler than slogan $ B= $ "bcb", but slogan $ A= $ "aaaaaa" is not cooler than slogan $ B= $ "aba".
You are given the company name $ w $ and your task is to help Bomboslav determine the length of the longest sequence of slogans $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , such that any slogan in the sequence is cooler than the previous one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the length of the company name that asks Bomboslav to help. The second line contains the string $ w $ of length $ n $ , that consists of lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
