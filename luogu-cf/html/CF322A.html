<h1>Ciel and Dancing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$FoxCiel$ 和她的同学在舞蹈室内，这里有$n$个男孩和$m$个女孩。他们从来没有跳过舞。有一些歌曲，在每一首歌曲中，有且仅有$1$名男孩和$1$名女孩在一起跳舞。除此之外，还有一些特殊的规则：
每一次跳舞的男孩和女孩中，至少有一人从未跳过舞。
请帮助$FoxCiel$制定一个计划，使得能够播放的歌曲数量尽可能最大。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fox Ciel and her friends are in a dancing room. There are $ n $ boys and $ m $ girls here, and they never danced before. There will be some songs, during each song, there must be exactly one boy and one girl are dancing. Besides, there is a special rule:
- either the boy in the dancing pair must dance for the first time (so, he didn't dance with anyone before);
- or the girl in the dancing pair must dance for the first time.
Help Fox Ciel to make a schedule that they can dance as many songs as possible.</div>

And in test case 2, we have 2 boys with 2 girls, the answer is 3.</div>
