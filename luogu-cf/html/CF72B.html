<h1>INI-file</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The INI file format is a de facto standard for configuration files. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure. They are commonly associated with Microsoft Windows, but are also used on other platforms.
Each line in INI-file stands for key-value mapping or defines new section. A key-value line has a format "key=value",where key — is the name of some property, and value — it's value. It is possible that it will be spaces from the both sides of key and/or value, the spaces should be ignored.
A section line has a format "\[section\]". It means that all key-value lines after it define properties of the specified section. Of cause, the following section line changes the current section. A section line may have spaces around any of brackets.
Also you should ignore comment lines — the first non-space character of comment line is ";".
You task is to write the program which will format given INI-file in a special way:
- first, print key-value lines which do not belong to any section;
- print all the sections in the lexicographical (alphabetical) order of their names;
- inside each of two previous items, order key-value lines lexicographically by "key";
- if there are more than one key-value lines with the same key inside a single section (or outside any sections), leave only one line (which appears later in the input data);
- remove all redundant spaces and lines.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=510 $ ) — the number of lines in given INI-file.
The rest of the input contains a valid INI-file in $ n $ lines. Values of section, key and value contain only Latin letters, digits, "." and/or "-".
Each line has length not exceeding 255 characters and not less than 1 character. The total length of all the lines does’t exceed 10000.</div>
