<h1>Petya and Graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义图权 $=$ 图中边权总和 $-$ 图中点权总和（空图的图权 $= 0$），求 $n$ 个点 $m$ 条边的无向图最大权子图。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya has a simple graph (that is, a graph without loops or multiple edges) consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges.
The weight of the $ i $ -th vertex is $ a_i $ .
The weight of the $ i $ -th edge is $ w_i $ .
A subgraph of a graph is some set of the graph vertices and some set of the graph edges. The set of edges must meet the condition: both ends of each edge from the set must belong to the chosen set of vertices.
The weight of a subgraph is the sum of the weights of its edges, minus the sum of the weights of its vertices. You need to find the maximum weight of subgraph of given graph. The given graph does not contain loops and multiple edges.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^3, 0 \le m \le 10^3 $ ) - the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 $ ) - the weights of the vertices of the graph.
The following $ m $ lines contain edges: the $ i $ -e edge is defined by a triple of integers $ v_i, u_i, w_i $ ( $ 1 \le v_i, u_i \le n, 1 \le w_i \le 10^9, v_i \neq u_i $ ). This triple means that between the vertices $ v_i $ and $ u_i $ there is an edge of weight $ w_i $ . It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain loops and multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the maximum weight of the subgraph of the given graph.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test example, the optimal subgraph consists of the vertices $ {1, 3, 4} $ and has weight $ 4 + 4 + 5 - (1 + 2 + 2) = 8 $ . In the second test case, the optimal subgraph is empty.</div>
