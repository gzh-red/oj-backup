<h1>Timofey and remoduling</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Timofey likes integers a lot. Unfortunately, he is very young and can't work with very big integers, so he does all the operations modulo his favorite prime $ m $ . Also, Timofey likes to look for arithmetical progressions everywhere.
One of his birthday presents was a sequence of distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Timofey wants to know whether he can rearrange the elements of the sequence so that is will be an arithmetical progression modulo $ m $ , or not.
Arithmetical progression modulo $ m $ of length $ n $ with first element $ x $ and difference $ d $ is sequence of integers $ x,x+d,x+2d,...,x+(n-1)·d $ , each taken modulo $ m $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ m $ and $ n $ ( $ 2<=m<=10^{9}+7 $ , $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ m $ is prime) — Timofey's favorite prime module and the length of the sequence.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}&lt;m $ ) — the elements of the sequence.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print -1 if it is not possible to rearrange the elements of the sequence so that is will be an arithmetical progression modulo $ m $ .
Otherwise, print two integers — the first element of the obtained progression $ x $ ( $ 0<=x&lt;m $ ) and its difference $ d $ ( $ 0<=d&lt;m $ ).
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
