<h1>New Year and Hurry</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Limak有n个任务，完成时间分别为1×5,2×5,……，n×5。而Limak走到他朋友家需要k分钟。问他在4小时内在确保能到达朋友家的同时最多能做多少任务。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Limak is going to participate in a contest on the last day of the 2016. The contest will start at 20:00 and will last four hours, exactly until midnight. There will be $ n $ problems, sorted by difficulty, i.e. problem $ 1 $ is the easiest and problem $ n $ is the hardest. Limak knows it will take him $ 5·i $ minutes to solve the $ i $ -th problem.
Limak's friends organize a New Year's Eve party and Limak wants to be there at midnight or earlier. He needs $ k $ minutes to get there from his house, where he will participate in the contest first.
How many problems can Limak solve if he wants to make it to the party?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10 $ , $ 1<=k<=240 $ ) — the number of the problems in the contest and the number of minutes Limak needs to get to the party from his house.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer, denoting the maximum possible number of problems Limak can solve so that he could get to the party at midnight or earlier.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are $ 3 $ problems and Limak needs $ 222 $ minutes to get to the party. The three problems require $ 5 $ , $ 10 $ and $ 15 $ minutes respectively. Limak can spend $ 5+10=15 $ minutes to solve first two problems. Then, at 20:15 he can leave his house to get to the party at 23:57 (after $ 222 $ minutes). In this scenario Limak would solve $ 2 $ problems. He doesn't have enough time to solve $ 3 $ problems so the answer is $ 2 $ .
In the second sample, Limak can solve all $ 4 $ problems in $ 5+10+15+20=50 $ minutes. At 20:50 he will leave the house and go to the party. He will get there exactly at midnight.
In the third sample, Limak needs only $ 1 $ minute to get to the party. He has enough time to solve all $ 7 $ problems.</div>
