<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya has $ k $ matches, placed in $ n $ matchboxes lying in a line from left to right. We know that $ k $ is divisible by $ n $ . Petya wants all boxes to have the same number of matches inside. For that, he can move a match from its box to the adjacent one in one move. How many such moves does he need to achieve the desired configuration?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=50000 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ non-negative numbers that do not exceed $ 10^{9} $ , the $ i $ -th written number is the number of matches in the $ i $ -th matchbox. It is guaranteed that the total number of matches is divisible by $ n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
