<h1>Choosing Subtree is Fun</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一棵$n$个结点的树，树上结点从1到$n$标号。
定义树上一个连通子图的权值为最长的区间$[l,r]$的长度，满足标号在$[l,r]$之间的结点均在这个连通子图中。
现在请你求出树上所有的结点数量不超过$k$的连通子图的权值最大值。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a tree consisting of $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
Let's define the length of an interval $ [l,r] $ as the value $ r-l+1 $ . The score of a subtree of this tree is the maximum length of such an interval $ [l,r] $ that, the vertices with numbers $ l,l+1,...,r $ belong to the subtree.
Considering all subtrees of the tree whose size is at most $ k $ , return the maximum score of the subtree. Note, that in this problem tree is not rooted, so a subtree — is an arbitrary connected subgraph of the tree.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are two integers in the first line, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=10^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ). That means $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are connected by a tree edge.
It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output should contain a single integer — the maximum possible score.</div>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first case, there is some subtree whose size is at most $ 6 $ , including $ 3 $ consecutive numbers of vertices. For example, the subtree that consists of $ {1,3,4,5,7,8} $ or of $ {1,4,6,7,8,10} $ includes $ 3 $ consecutive numbers of vertices. But there is no subtree whose size is at most $ 6 $ , which includes $ 4 $ or more consecutive numbers of vertices.</div>
