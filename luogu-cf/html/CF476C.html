<h1>Dreamoon and Sums</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$a,b(a,b\le10^7)$，求
$$\sum_x x\times [1\le\frac{\lfloor x/b\rfloor}{x\mod b}\le a]$$
上式的中括号为艾佛森括号。
答案对$10^9+7$取模。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dreamoon loves summing up something for no reason. One day he obtains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ occasionally. He wants to calculate the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer $ x $ is called nice if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476C/4c08c1c4aa605a7661ec02846fcac8a50385ec4f.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476C/199c47ec051f565599e933f0f95a0d9069b4a2ef.png), where $ k $ is some integer number in range $ \[1,a\] $ .
By ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476C/f26b8897bea7b2ad070a91154fff6b5d3d6ecc9d.png) we denote the quotient of integer division of $ x $ and $ y $ . By ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476C/e60b09b62a19a62f637ba6a66556f554bcb4dbf9.png) we denote the remainder of integer division of $ x $ and $ y $ . You can read more about these operations here: http://goo.gl/AcsXhT.
The answer may be large, so please print its remainder modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ). Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line of the input contains two integers $ a $ , $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=10^{7} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer representing the answer modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, there are no nice integers because ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476C/05cf42fbd3551fd38e1ab2adca655a95016ccd28.png) is always zero.
For the second sample, the set of nice integers is $ {3,5} $ .</div>
