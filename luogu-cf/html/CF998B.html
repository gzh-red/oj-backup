<h1>Cutting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are a lot of things which could be cut — trees, paper, "the rope". In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.
There is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.
Cuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, $ [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5] $ $ \to $ two cuts $ \to $ $ [4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5] $ . On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.
The cost of the cut between $ x $ and $ y $ numbers is $ |x - y| $ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $ B $ bitcoins.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 100 $ ) and an integer $ B $ ( $ 1 \le B \le 100 $ ) — the number of elements in the sequence and the number of bitcoins you have.
Second line contains $ n $ integers: $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ ) — elements of the sequence, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible number of cuts which can be made while spending no more than $ B $ bitcoins.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the optimal answer is to split sequence between $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ . Price of this cut is equal to $ 3 $ bitcoins.
In the second sample it is not possible to make even one cut even with unlimited number of bitcoins.
In the third sample the sequence should be cut between $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ , and between $ 4 $ and $ 5 $ . The total price of the cuts is $ 1 + 1 = 2 $ bitcoins.</div>
