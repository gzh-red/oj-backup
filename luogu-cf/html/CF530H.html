<h1>Points in triangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a set of points on a plane with positive integer coordinates. Find a triangle of minimum area with vertices in points $ (0,0) $ , $ (A,0) $ and $ (0,B) $ ( $ A $ and $ B $ are unknown positive integers) that contains all the given points inside it (points on the edges count towards being inside).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=100 $ ) — the number of points. The following $ N $ lines contain pairs of numbers $ X $ and $ Y $ ( $ 1<=X,Y<=100 $ ) - the coordinates of the points. All points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one floating-point number — the minimal area of the triangle. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-4} $ .</div>
