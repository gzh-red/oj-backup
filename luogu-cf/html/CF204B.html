<h1>Little Elephant and Cards</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小象喜欢玩卡牌。
他有n张牌，每张牌都有两种颜色（正面的颜色和背面的颜色）。初始，所有的牌都以正面朝上放在桌子上。每一次，小象可以将任何卡片翻转。小象认为，如果至少有一半的卡片具有相同的颜色（对于每张卡片考虑上侧的颜色），则桌子上的一组卡片是有趣的。
帮助小象找到使这套牌有趣所需的最少移动次数。
输入
第一行包含一个整数$n( 1 <= n <= 10^5)$ -的卡的数量。接下来n行,每行两个整数,描述每一张牌两侧的颜色。一行中的第一个数字是卡片正面的颜色，第二个数字则是背面的颜色。卡片正面的颜色可能与卡片背面的颜色一致。
行中的数字由单个空格分隔。
输出
在一行上输出一个整数寻求的最小移动次数。如果不可能让该组合变得有趣，输出-1。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Little Elephant loves to play with color cards.
He has $ n $ cards, each has exactly two colors (the color of the front side and the color of the back side). Initially, all the cards lay on the table with the front side up. In one move the Little Elephant can turn any card to the other side. The Little Elephant thinks that a set of cards on the table is funny if at least half of the cards have the same color (for each card the color of the upper side is considered).
Help the Little Elephant to find the minimum number of moves needed to make the set of $ n $ cards funny.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of the cards. The following $ n $ lines contain the description of all cards, one card per line. The cards are described by a pair of positive integers not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ — colors of both sides. The first number in a line is the color of the front of the card, the second one — of the back. The color of the front of the card may coincide with the color of the back of the card.
The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line print a single integer — the sought minimum number of moves. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample there initially are three cards lying with colors 4, 4, 7. Since two of the three cards are of the same color 4, you do not need to change anything, so the answer is 0.
In the second sample, you can turn the first and the fourth cards. After that three of the five cards will be of color 7.</div>
