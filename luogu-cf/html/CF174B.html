<h1>File List</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个只包含小写字母'a'~'z'和'.'的字符串S.（$|S|\leq4*10^{5}$）
你需要将其分割成多个字符串，每个字符串的形式如 _A.B_ ，其中A是一个长度在1~8之间的小写字母字符串，B是一个长度在1~3之间的小写字母字符串。
**如$qwq.qwq$，$abcdefgh.i$都是合法的；**
**如$Luogu.org$，$luogu.com.cn$，$yingyingying.png$，$j.klmn$，$ccf$都是不合法的。**
如果没有分割方案，请输出“NO”；
否则输出“YES”，并在随后的数行中每行输出一个字符串，表示分割出的一个合法字符串。请保证你输出的这些字符串按顺序依次拼接后恰为S。
如果有多种方案，任意输出一种即可。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Eudokimus, a system administrator is in trouble again. As a result of an error in some script, a list of names of very important files has been damaged. Since they were files in the BerFS file system, it is known that each file name has a form "name.ext", where:
- name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 8 characters;
- ext is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, its length is from 1 to 3 characters.
For example, "read.me", "example.txt" and "b.cpp" are valid file names and "version.info", "ntldr" and "contestdata.zip" are not.
Damage to the list meant that all the file names were recorded one after another, without any separators. So now Eudokimus has a single string.
Eudokimus needs to set everything right as soon as possible. He should divide the resulting string into parts so that each part would be a valid file name in BerFS. Since Eudokimus has already proved that he is not good at programming, help him. The resulting file list can contain the same file names.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data consists of a single string $ s $ , its length is from $ 1 $ to $ 4·10^{5} $ characters. The string can contain only lowercase Latin letters ('a' - 'z') and periods ('.').</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print "YES" (without the quotes), if it is possible to divide $ s $ into parts as required. In this case, the following lines should contain the parts of the required partition, one per line in the order in which they appear in $ s $ . The required partition can contain the same file names. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
If the solution does not exist, then print in a single line "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
