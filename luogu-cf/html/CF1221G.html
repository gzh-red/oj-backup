<h1>Graph And Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个n个顶点m条边的无向图，在每个顶点上写数字（0或1），然后每条边的值为两个端点值之和。
使得至少有一条边为0，至少有一条边为1，至少有一条边为2，有多少种（在顶点）写数的方案。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an undirected graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. You have to write a number on each vertex of this graph, each number should be either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ . After that, you write a number on each edge equal to the sum of numbers on vertices incident to that edge.
You have to choose the numbers you will write on the vertices so that there is at least one edge with $ 0 $ written on it, at least one edge with $ 1 $ and at least one edge with $ 2 $ . How many ways are there to do it? Two ways to choose numbers are different if there exists at least one vertex which has different numbers written on it in these two ways.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 40 $ , $ 0 \le m \le \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} $ ) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.
Then $ m $ lines follow, each line contains two numbers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \le x_i, y_i \le n $ , $ x_i \ne y_i $ ) — the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge. It is guaranteed that each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the number of ways to write numbers on all vertices so that there exists at least one edge with $ 0 $ written on it, at least one edge with $ 1 $ and at least one edge with $ 2 $ .</div>
