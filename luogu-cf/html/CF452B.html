<h1>4-point polyline</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你将会得到一个从(0,0)到(n,m)的矩形网格点。你必须选择恰好4个不同的点来建立一个线，可能有自我交叉点和自我接触。这条折线应该尽可能长。
输入的唯一一行包含两个整数n和m(0<=n，m<=1000)。保证网格至少包含4个不同的点
输出有4行，每行有两个整数，整数之间用空格连接，这些坐标代表最长的可能的折线。（误差不超过$10^{-6}$）

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rectangular grid of lattice points from $ (0,0) $ to $ (n,m) $ inclusive. You have to choose exactly 4 different points to build a polyline possibly with self-intersections and self-touching. This polyline should be as long as possible.
A polyline defined by points $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4} $ consists of the line segments $ p_{1}p_{2},p_{2}p_{3},p_{3}p_{4} $ , and its length is the sum of the lengths of the individual line segments.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (0<=n,m<=1000) $ . It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points $ p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4} $ in order which represent the longest possible polyline.
Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with $ 10^{-6} $ precision.</div>
