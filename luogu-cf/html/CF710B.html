<h1>Optimal Point on a Line</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题意
给你n个点，为数轴上的点。找到一个x点，使它到所有数的距离的和最小。
## 输入
第一行，一个数n（1<=n<=3*10^5）
第二行，n个数，分别为x{i}（−10^9<=x{i}<=10^9）
## 输出
输出一个数，为到所有数的距离的和最小的数，如果有多个，则输出最左边的（数轴上）。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ points on a line with their coordinates $ x_{i} $ . Find the point $ x $ so the sum of distances to the given points is minimal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of points on the line.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ x_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the given $ n $ points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only integer $ x $ — the position of the optimal point on the line. If there are several optimal points print the position of the leftmost one. It is guaranteed that the answer is always the integer.</div>
