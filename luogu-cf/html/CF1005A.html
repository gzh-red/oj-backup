输入输出格式：
输入格式：
第一行，一个数：N
第二行N个数，分别是组成M个序列的元素
输出格式：
第一行，一个数：M
第二行，M个数，分别是这M个序列的长度</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $ 1 $ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains $ 3 $ steps, and the second contains $ 4 $ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4 $ .
You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.
The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 1000 $ ) — the total number of numbers pronounced by Tanya.
The second line contains integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 1000 $ ) — all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the stairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a stairway with $ x $ steps, she will pronounce the numbers $ 1, 2, \dots, x $ in that order.
The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, output $ t $ — the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the second line, output $ t $ numbers — the number of steps in each stairway she climbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.</div>
