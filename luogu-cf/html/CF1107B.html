<h1>Digital root</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
一个非负数的数字根由反复的数位和计算得来，每一次计算
使用前一次计算得来的结果计算数位和，直到计算结果为1位数为止。
若将x的数字根称作S(x)，则S(5)=5
S(38)=S(3+8=11)=S(1+1=2)=2
S(10)=S(1+0=1)=1
现在需要你找出数字根为x的第k个正数。（每个测试点有n个这样的问题）
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
第一行：一个整数n（1≤n≤10^3），表示该测试点的问题数
接下来的n行，每行包含两个整数ki,xi（1<=ki<=10^12,1<=xi<=9)
表示对于第i个问题，你需要找出数字根为xi的第ki个正数
### 输出格式
n行，第i行包含一个整数：第i个问题的答案
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today at the lesson of mathematics, Petya learns about the digital root.
The digital root of a non-negative integer is the single digit value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.
Let's denote the digital root of $ x $ as $ S(x) $ . Then $ S(5)=5 $ , $ S(38)=S(3+8=11)=S(1+1=2)=2 $ , $ S(10)=S(1+0=1)=1 $ .
As a homework Petya got $ n $ tasks of the form: find $ k $ -th positive number whose digital root is $ x $ .
Petya has already solved all the problems, but he doesn't know if it's right. Your task is to solve all $ n $ tasks from Petya's homework.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^3 $ ) — the number of tasks in Petya's homework. The next $ n $ lines contain two integers $ k_i $ ( $ 1 \le k_i \le 10^{12} $ ) and $ x_i $ ( $ 1 \le x_i \le 9 $ ) — $ i $ -th Petya's task in which you need to find a $ k_i $ -th positive number, the digital root of which is $ x_i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ lines, $ i $ -th line should contain a single integer — the answer to the $ i $ -th problem.</div>
