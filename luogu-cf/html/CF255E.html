<h1>Furlo and Rublo and Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Furlo and Rublo play a game. The table has $ n $ piles of coins lying on it, the $ i $ -th pile has $ a_{i} $ coins. Furlo and Rublo move in turns, Furlo moves first. In one move you are allowed to:
- choose some pile, let's denote the current number of coins in it as $ x $ ;
- choose some integer $ y $ $ (0<=y&lt;x; x^{1/4}<=y<=x^{1/2}) $ and decrease the number of coins in this pile to $ y $ . In other words, after the described move the pile will have $ y $ coins left.
The player who can't make a move, loses.
Your task is to find out, who wins in the given game if both Furlo and Rublo play optimally well.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=77777) $ — the number of piles. The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=777777777777) $ — the sizes of piles. The numbers are separated by single spaces.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If both players play optimally well and Furlo wins, print "Furlo", otherwise print "Rublo". Print the answers without the quotes.</div>
