<h1>Check Transcription</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个01串$s$和一个由小写字母构成的字符串$t$,其中0和1可以替换成任意**不同**的字符串,问有多少种替换方法使得01串$s$能被替换成$t$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal $ s $ towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response $ t $ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $ t $ is similar to $ s $ .
The original signal $ s $ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $ t $ , however, does not look as easy as $ s $ , but the scientists don't give up! They represented $ t $ as a sequence of English letters and say that $ t $ is similar to $ s $ if you can replace all zeros in $ s $ with some string $ r_0 $ and all ones in $ s $ with some other string $ r_1 $ and obtain $ t $ . The strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ must be different and non-empty.
Please help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ ) that transform $ s $ to $ t $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a string $ s $ ( $ 2 \le |s| \le 10^5 $ ) consisting of zeros and ones — the original signal.
The second line contains a string $ t $ ( $ 1 \le |t| \le 10^6 $ ) consisting of lowercase English letters only — the received signal.
It is guaranteed, that the string $ s $ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of pairs of strings $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ that transform $ s $ to $ t $ .
In case there are no such pairs, print $ 0 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
01
aaaaaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
4
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
001
kokokokotlin
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the possible pairs $ (r_0, r_1) $ are as follows:
- "a", "aaaaa"
- "aa", "aaaa"
- "aaaa", "aa"
- "aaaaa", "a"
The pair "aaa", "aaa" is not allowed, since $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ must be different.
In the second example, the following pairs are possible:
- "ko", "kokotlin"
- "koko", "tlin"</div>
