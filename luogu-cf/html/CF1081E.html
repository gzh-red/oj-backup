<h1>Missing Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定长度为n（n为偶数）的数列x的偶数项，求出数列x的奇数项，使得对于任意t∈[1,n]，x1+x2+...+xt为平方数，若无解输出No，否则先输出一行Yes，再输出x1,x2,x3,...,xn，若有多解输出任意一组解。
x数组奇数项不超过10^13，偶数项不超过10^5，n<=10^5。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chouti is working on a strange math problem.
There was a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $ , where $ n $ is even. The sequence was very special, namely for every integer $ t $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , $ x_1+x_2+...+x_t $ is a square of some integer number (that is, a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number)).
Somehow, the numbers with odd indexes turned to be missing, so he is only aware of numbers on even positions, i.e. $ x_2, x_4, x_6, \ldots, x_n $ . The task for him is to restore the original sequence. Again, it's your turn to help him.
The problem setter might make mistakes, so there can be no possible sequence at all. If there are several possible sequences, you can output any.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an even number $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 10^5 $ ).
The second line contains $ \frac{n}{2} $ positive integers $ x_2, x_4, \ldots, x_n $ ( $ 1 \le x_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there are no possible sequence, print "No".
Otherwise, print "Yes" and then $ n $ positive integers $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $ ( $ 1 \le x_i \le 10^{13} $ ), where $ x_2, x_4, \ldots, x_n $ should be same as in input data. If there are multiple answers, print any.
Note, that the limit for $ x_i $ is larger than for input data. It can be proved that in case there is an answer, there must be a possible sequence satisfying $ 1 \le x_i \le 10^{13} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6
5 11 44
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Yes
4 5 16 11 64 44

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Yes
100 9900

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>6

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>No
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example
- $ x_1=4 $
- $ x_1+x_2=9 $
- $ x_1+x_2+x_3=25 $
- $ x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=36 $
- $ x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5=100 $
- $ x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5+x_6=144 $
All these numbers are perfect squares.In the second example, $ x_1=100 $ , $ x_1+x_2=10000 $ . They are all perfect squares. There're other answers possible. For example, $ x_1=22500 $ is another answer.
In the third example, it is possible to show, that no such sequence exists.</div>
