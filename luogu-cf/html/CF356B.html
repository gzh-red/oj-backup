<h1>Xenia and Hamming</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Xenia is an amateur programmer. Today on the IT lesson she learned about the Hamming distance.
The Hamming distance between two strings $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{n} $ and $ t=t_{1}t_{2}...\ t_{n} $ of equal length $ n $ is value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF356B/52be4f702633b5f90851e953f1a83180e97e66f8.png). Record $ [s_{i}≠t_{i}] $ is the Iverson notation and represents the following: if $ s_{i}≠t_{i} $ , it is one, otherwise — zero.
Now Xenia wants to calculate the Hamming distance between two long strings $ a $ and $ b $ . The first string $ a $ is the concatenation of $ n $ copies of string $ x $ , that is, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF356B/b9012edec23a9faf329465fd2157f0252f5a66d1.png). The second string $ b $ is the concatenation of $ m $ copies of string $ y $ .
Help Xenia, calculate the required Hamming distance, given $ n,x,m,y $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{12}) $ . The second line contains a non-empty string $ x $ . The third line contains a non-empty string $ y $ . Both strings consist of at most $ 10^{6} $ lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that strings $ a $ and $ b $ that you obtain from the input have the same length.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the required Hamming distance.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case string $ a $ is the same as string $ b $ and equals 100 letters a. As both strings are equal, the Hamming distance between them is zero.
In the second test case strings $ a $ and $ b $ differ in their 3-rd, 5-th, 6-th and 7-th characters. Thus, the Hamming distance equals 4.
In the third test case string $ a $ is rzrrzr and string $ b $ is azazaz. The strings differ in all characters apart for the second one, the Hamming distance between them equals 5.</div>
