<h1>Reachability from the Capital</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ cities and $ m $ roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.
What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?
New roads will also be one-way.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input consists of three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ s $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 5000, 0 \le m \le 5000, 1 \le s \le n $ ) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
The following $ m $ lines contain roads: road $ i $ is given as a pair of cities $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ ( $ 1 \le u_i, v_i \le n $ , $ u_i \ne v_i $ ). For each pair of cities $ (u, v) $ , there can be at most one road from $ u $ to $ v $ . Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $ u $ to $ v $ and from $ v $ to $ u $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city $ s $ . If all the cities are already reachable from $ s $ , print 0.</div>

The second example is illustrated by the following:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF999E/62d78c6df2be4fcc0d6c17ba856e4ad627c47d5f.png)In this example, you can add any one of the roads ( $ 5, 1 $ ), ( $ 5, 2 $ ), ( $ 5, 3 $ ), ( $ 5, 4 $ ) to make all the cities reachable from $ s = 5 $ .</div>
