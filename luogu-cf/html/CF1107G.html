<h1>Vasya and Maximum Profit</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya got really tired of these credits (from problem F) and now wants to earn the money himself! He decided to make a contest to gain a profit.
Vasya has $ n $ problems to choose from. They are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The difficulty of the $ i $ -th problem is $ d_i $ . Moreover, the problems are given in the increasing order by their difficulties. The difficulties of all tasks are pairwise distinct. In order to add the $ i $ -th problem to the contest you need to pay $ c_i $ burles to its author. For each problem in the contest Vasya gets $ a $ burles.
In order to create a contest he needs to choose a consecutive subsegment of tasks.
So the total earnings for the contest are calculated as follows:
- if Vasya takes problem $ i $ to the contest, he needs to pay $ c_i $ to its author;
- for each problem in the contest Vasya gets $ a $ burles;
- let $ gap(l, r) = \max\limits_{l \le i < r} (d_{i + 1} - d_i)^2 $ . If Vasya takes all the tasks with indices from $ l $ to $ r $ to the contest, he also needs to pay $ gap(l, r) $ . If $ l = r $ then $ gap(l, r) = 0 $ .
Calculate the maximum profit that Vasya can earn by taking a consecutive segment of tasks.</div>

<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ a $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le a \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of proposed tasks and the profit for a single problem, respectively.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ d_i $ and $ c_i $ ( $ 1 \le d_i, c_i \le 10^9, d_i < d_{i+1} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
