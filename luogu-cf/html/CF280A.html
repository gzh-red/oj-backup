<h1>Rectangle Puzzle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目背景
一个平面上有两个矩形。
## 题目描述
两个矩形的中心都位于坐标轴原点（即矩形对称的中心）。
第一个矩形的边与坐标轴平行，与$x$轴平行的边的长度等于$w$，与$y$轴平行的边的长度等于$h$。
第二个矩形可以通过用角度$α$相对于坐标原点旋转第一个矩形来获得。
请你求出两个矩形的重叠面积（图中阴影面积）

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two rectangles on a plane. The centers of both rectangles are located in the origin of coordinates (meaning the center of the rectangle's symmetry). The first rectangle's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes: the length of the side that is parallel to the $ Ox $ axis, equals $ w $ , the length of the side that is parallel to the $ Oy $ axis, equals $ h $ . The second rectangle can be obtained by rotating the first rectangle relative to the origin of coordinates by angle $ α $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF280A/052b43ecd665cd6e4ffd3e118c46f92dcd4eb612.png)Your task is to find the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles. This region is shaded in the picture.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ w,h,α $ $ (1<=w,h<=10^{6}; 0<=α<=180) $ . Angle $ α $ is given in degrees.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a real number — the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles.
The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
