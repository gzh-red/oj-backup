<h1>Bear and Rectangle Strips</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Limak has a grid that consists of $ 2 $ rows and $ n $ columns. The $ j $ -th cell in the $ i $ -th row contains an integer $ t_{i,j} $ which can be positive, negative or zero.
A non-empty rectangle of cells is called nice if and only if the sum of numbers in its cells is equal to $ 0 $ .
Limak wants to choose some nice rectangles and give them to his friends, as gifts. No two chosen rectangles should share a cell. What is the maximum possible number of nice rectangles Limak can choose?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=300000 $ ) — the number of columns in the grid.
The next two lines contain numbers in the grid. The $ i $ -th of those two lines contains $ n $ integers $ t_{i,1},t_{i,2},...,t_{i,n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=t_{i,j}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer, denoting the maximum possible number of cell-disjoint nice rectangles.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are four nice rectangles:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF771E/01e27af3548be65e50eb7b98af0fa04ea831f0c5.png)Limak can't choose all of them because they are not disjoint. He should take three nice rectangles: those denoted as blue frames on the drawings.
In the second sample, it's optimal to choose six nice rectangles, each consisting of one cell with a number $ 0 $ .
In the third sample, the only nice rectangle is the whole grid — the sum of all numbers is $ 0 $ . Clearly, Limak can choose at most one nice rectangle, so the answer is $ 1 $ .</div>
