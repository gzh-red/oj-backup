<h1>Exploration plan</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个 $v$ 个点 $e$ 条边的带权无向图，在图上有 $n$ 个人，第 $i$ 个人位于点 $x_i$，一个人通过一条边需要花费这条边的边权的时间。
现在每个人可以自由地走。求最短多少时间后满足结束后有人的节点数 ≥ $m$
$n, v \leq 500$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The competitors of Bubble Cup X gathered after the competition and discussed what is the best way to get to know the host country and its cities.
After exploring the map of Serbia for a while, the competitors came up with the following facts: the country has $ V $ cities which are indexed with numbers from $ 1 $ to $ V $ , and there are $ E $ bi-directional roads that connect the cites. Each road has a weight (the time needed to cross that road). There are $ N $ teams at the Bubble Cup and the competitors came up with the following plan: each of the $ N $ teams will start their journey in one of the $ V $ cities, and some of the teams share the starting position.
They want to find the shortest time $ T $ , such that every team can move in these $ T $ minutes, and the number of different cities they end up in is at least $ K $ (because they will only get to know the cities they end up in). A team doesn't have to be on the move all the time, if they like it in a particular city, they can stay there and wait for the time to pass.
Please help the competitors to determine the shortest time $ T $ so it's possible for them to end up in at least $ K $ different cities or print -1 if that is impossible no matter how they move.
Note that there can exist multiple roads between some cities.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers: $ V $ , $ E $ , $ N $ and $ K\ (1<=V<=600,\ 1<=E<=20000,\ 1<=N<=min(V,200),\ 1<=K<=N) $ , number of cities, number of roads, number of teams and the smallest number of different cities they need to end up in, respectively.
The second line contains $ N $ integers, the cities where the teams start their journey.
Next $ E $ lines contain information about the roads in following format: $ A_{i}\ B_{i}\ T_{i}\ (1<=A_{i},B_{i}<=V,\ 1<=T_{i}<=10000) $ , which means that there is a road connecting cities $ A_{i} $ and $ B_{i} $ , and you need $ T_{i} $ minutes to cross that road.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer that represents the minimal time the teams can move for, such that they end up in at least $ K $ different cities or output -1 if there is no solution.
If the solution exists, result will be no greater than $ 1731311 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Three teams start from city 5, and two teams start from city 2. If they agree to move for 3 minutes, one possible situation would be the following: Two teams in city 2, one team in city 5, one team in city 3 , and one team in city 1. And we see that there are four different cities the teams end their journey at.</div>
