<h1>Tree of Life (medium)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Heidi got tired of deciphering the prophecy hidden in the Tree of Life and decided to go back to her headquarters, rest a little and try there. Of course, she cannot uproot the Tree and take it with her, so she made a drawing of the Tree on a piece of paper. On second thought, she made more identical drawings so as to have $ n $ in total (where $ n $ is the number of vertices of the Tree of Life) – who knows what might happen?
Indeed, on her way back Heidi was ambushed by a group of zombies. While she managed to fend them off, they have damaged her drawings in a peculiar way: from the $ i $ -th copy, the vertex numbered $ i $ was removed, along with all adjacent edges. In each picture, the zombies have also erased all the vertex numbers and relabeled the remaining $ n-1 $ vertices arbitrarily using numbers $ 1 $ to $ n $ (fortunately, each vertex still has a distinct number). What's more, the drawings have been arbitrarily shuffled/reordered.
Now Heidi wants to recover the Tree of Life from her descriptions of all the drawings (as lists of edges).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains $ Z<=20 $ – the number of test cases. $ Z $ descriptions of single test cases follow.
In each test case, the first line of input contains numbers $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) and $ k $ (where $ k $ is the number of drawings; we have $ k=n $ ). In the following lines, the descriptions of the $ k $ drawings are given. The description of the $ i $ -th drawing is a line containing $ m_{i} $ – the number of edges in this drawing, followed by $ m_{i} $ lines describing edges, each of which contains two space-separated integers –- the numbers of the two vertices connected by the edge.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Heidi's drawings cannot possibly come from a single tree, you should output the word NO. Otherwise, output one line containing the word YES and $ n-1 $ lines describing any tree that Heidi's drawings could have come from. For every edge you should output the numbers of the vertices that it connects, separated with a single space. If there are many solutions, print any of them.</div>
