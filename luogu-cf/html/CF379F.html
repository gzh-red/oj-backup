<h1>New Year Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你是一个程序猿，现在有一棵新年树（并不是传统的带着叶子的树）——它有四个节点： 1，2，3，4. 其中2，3，4的父亲都是1.
新年里，程序猿们往往会做一些有趣的事情。你则选择以往这棵树上加节点来取乐。 一个添加节点的操作是这样的：
1） 找到树上的一个叶子结点v 2） 设现在树上有n个节点，那么你现在会加入两个节点n+1和n+2，它们都会成为n的儿子.
你的任务是在做q次这样的操作，并在每做完一次后计算一次树的直径。来吧，我们一起来解决这道新年问题吧！
输入：
第一行一个整数q (1 ≤ q ≤ 5×10^5) ,表示操作次数。接下来q行，每行一个数v，表示你当前操作的节点。保证它一定是一个叶子结点。
输出：
q行，每行一个数，表示做了这个操作以后树的直径。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are a programmer and you have a New Year Tree (not the traditional fur tree, though) — a tree of four vertices: one vertex of degree three (has number 1), connected with three leaves (their numbers are from 2 to 4).
On the New Year, programmers usually have fun. You decided to have fun as well by adding vertices to the tree. One adding operation looks as follows:
- First we choose some leaf of the tree with number $ v $ .
- Let's mark the number of vertices on the tree at this moment by variable $ n $ , then two vertexes are added to the tree, their numbers are $ n+1 $ and $ n+2 $ , also you get new edges, one between vertices $ v $ and $ n+1 $ and one between vertices $ v $ and $ n+2 $ .
Your task is not just to model the process of adding vertices to the tree, but after each adding operation print the diameter of the current tree. Come on, let's solve the New Year problem!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ q $ $ (1<=q<=5·10^{5}) $ — the number of operations. Each of the next $ q $ lines contains integer $ v_{i} $ $ (1<=v_{i}<=n) $ — the operation of adding leaves to vertex $ v_{i} $ . Variable $ n $ represents the number of vertices in the current tree.
It is guaranteed that all given operations are correct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers — the diameter of the current tree after each operation.</div>
