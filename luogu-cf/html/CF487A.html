<h1>Fight the Monster</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A monster is attacking the Cyberland!
Master Yang, a braver, is going to beat the monster. Yang and the monster each have 3 attributes: hitpoints ( $ HP $ ), offensive power ( $ ATK $ ) and defensive power ( $ DEF $ ).
During the battle, every second the monster's HP decrease by $ max(0,ATK_{Y}-DEF_{M}) $ , while Yang's HP decreases by $ max(0,ATK_{M}-DEF_{Y}) $ , where index $ Y $ denotes Master Yang and index $ M $ denotes monster. Both decreases happen simultaneously Once monster's $ HP<=0 $ and the same time Master Yang's $ HP>0 $ , Master Yang wins.
Master Yang can buy attributes from the magic shop of Cyberland: $ h $ bitcoins per $ HP $ , $ a $ bitcoins per $ ATK $ , and $ d $ bitcoins per $ DEF $ .
Now Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win.</div>

Now Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only output line should contain an integer, denoting the minimum bitcoins Master Yang should spend in order to win.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 2 1
1 100 1
1 100 100

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, prices for $ ATK $ and $ DEF $ are extremely high. Master Yang can buy $ 99 $ HP, then he can beat the monster with $ 1 $ HP left.
For the second sample, Master Yang is strong enough to beat the monster, so he doesn't need to buy anything.</div>
