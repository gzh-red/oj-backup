<h1>Lose it!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有一个长度为$n$的序列$a$，其中每一个元素都是下列6种数字中的一个：$4,8,15,16,23,42$。
你的任务是删掉最少的元素，使得这个序列变成好的。
我们称一个长度为$k$的序列是好的，当且仅当$k$能被$6$整除并且这个序列能划分成$\dfrac k6$个子序列，使得每一个子序列都是$\{4,8,15,16,23,42\}$。
下面几个序列是好的序列：
$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]$（整个序列作为要求的子序列）；
$[4, 8, 4, 15, 16, 8, 23, 15, 16, 42, 23, 42]$（第一个子序列由第一，二，四，五，七，十个元素构成，第二个子序列由剩下的元素构成）；
$[]$（空序列是好的）.
下面几个序列是不好的序列：
$[4, 8, 15, 16, 42, 23]$
$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4]$
$[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 23]$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers. Each $ a_i $ is one of the six following numbers: $ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 $ .
Your task is to remove the minimum number of elements to make this array good.
An array of length $ k $ is called good if $ k $ is divisible by $ 6 $ and it is possible to split it into $ \frac{k}{6} $ subsequences $ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 $ .
Examples of good arrays:
- $ [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] $ (the whole array is a required sequence);
- $ [4, 8, 4, 15, 16, 8, 23, 15, 16, 42, 23, 42] $ (the first sequence is formed from first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth elements and the second one is formed from remaining elements);
- $ [] $ (the empty array is good).
Examples of bad arrays:
- $ [4, 8, 15, 16, 42, 23] $ (the order of elements should be exactly $ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 $ );
- $ [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4] $ (the length of the array is not divisible by $ 6 $ );
- $ [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 23] $ (the first sequence can be formed from first six elements but the remaining array cannot form the required sequence).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of elements in $ a $ .
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ (each $ a_i $ is one of the following numbers: $ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the $ i $ -th element of $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum number of elements you have to remove to obtain a good array.</div>
