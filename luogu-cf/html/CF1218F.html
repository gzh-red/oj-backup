<h1>Workout plan</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个目标 刚开始有 K 的分数 然后有n个目标，每次都需要达到$a_i$的分数，对于第i次，我可以选取前i个花费中的$c_i$（一个$c_i$只能选一次），并且花费$c_i$的代价提升$A$的分数，求最小的花费使得在$i$时刻，都能达到$a_i$的标准</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alan decided to get in shape for the summer, so he created a precise workout plan to follow. His plan is to go to a different gym every day during the next N days and lift $ X[i] $ grams on day $ i $ . In order to improve his workout performance at the gym, he can buy exactly one pre-workout drink at the gym he is currently in and it will improve his performance by $ A $ grams permanently and immediately. In different gyms these pre-workout drinks can cost different amounts $ C[i] $ because of the taste and the gym's location but its permanent workout gains are the same. Before the first day of starting his workout plan, Alan knows he can lift a maximum of $ K $ grams. Help Alan spend a minimum total amount of money in order to reach his workout plan. If there is no way for him to complete his workout plan successfully output $ -1 $ .</div>

The second line contains $ N $ integer numbers $ X[i] $ $ (1 \leq X[i] \leq 10^9) $ separated by a single space representing how many grams Alan wants to lift on day $ i $ . The third line contains one integer number $ A $ $ (1 \leq A \leq 10^9) $ representing permanent performance gains from a single drink. The last line contains $ N $ integer numbers $ C[i] $ $ (1 \leq C[i] \leq 10^9) $ , representing cost of performance booster drink in the gym he visits on day $ i $ .</div>
