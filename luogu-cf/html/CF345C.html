<h1>Counting Fridays</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述：13号星期五不适合你，所以你开始思考如何减少它对你生活的影响。你的日常活动是参加竞赛。
你不希望在任何13号星期五参加任何竞赛。
**
_管理员告诉你了竞赛未来几年举行的日期。请问有多少竞赛日期在13号星期五。_
输入：n，以下 n行 为日期；
输出：sum；</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Judging from the previous problem, Friday the 13th really doesn't treat you well, so you start thinking about how to minimize its impact on your life. You are a passionate participant of programming contests, so various competitions are an important part of your schedule. Naturally, you'd like as few of them to be spoiled as possible.
A friendly admin leaked to you the list of dates on which the contests will be held for several years ahead. Check how many of them happen to take place on Friday the 13th of any month.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10) $ — the number of the contests you have been told about. The following $ n $ lines contain dates of these contests, one per line, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD" (1974 $ <= $ YYYY $ <= $ 2030; 01 $ <= $ MM $ <= $ 12; 01 $ <= $ DD $ <= $ 31). It's guarateed that all the given dates are correct. Two distinct contests may be at the same day.</div>
