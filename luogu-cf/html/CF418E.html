<h1>Tricky Password</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In order to ensure confidentiality, the access to the "Russian Code Cup" problems is password protected during the problem development process.
To select a password, the jury can generate a special table that contains $ n $ columns and the infinite number of rows. To construct a table, the first row is fixed, and all the others are obtained by the following rule:
In the row $ i $ at position $ p $ there is a number equal to the number of times $ a[i-1][p] $ occurs on the prefix $ a[i-1][1...\ p] $ .
To ensure the required level of confidentiality, the jury must be able to perform the following operations:
- Replace number $ a[1][p] $ by $ v $ and rebuild the table.
- Find the number $ a[x][y] $ , which will be the new password.
Doing all these steps manually is very tedious, so the jury asks you to help him. Write a program that responds to the request of the jury.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of columns. The second line contains the description of the first row of the table, that is, $ n $ integers, which are not less than $ 1 $ and do not exceed $ 10^{9} $ .
The third line of the input contains an integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=100000 $ ) — the number of requests.
Next, each row contains a description of the request, which consists of three integers:
- If the first number is equal to $ 1 $ , then the remaining two numbers are $ v $ , $ p $ ( $ 1<=v<=10^{9} $ ; $ 1<=p<=n $ ). So, you should put value $ v $ in the position $ p $ in the first row.
- If the first number is equal to $ 2 $ , then the remaining two numbers are $ x $ , $ y $ ( $ 1<=x<=10^{5} $ ; $ 1<=y<=n $ ) — the row and column of the table cell from which you want to get value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print an answer for each request of the second type in the order you receive them.</div>
