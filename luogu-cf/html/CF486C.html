<h1>Palindrome Transformation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入第一行为两个数字n,p（$1\leq p\leq n\leq10^5$），n表示字符串长度为n,p表示初始状态光标位于字符串第p个字符处。
输入第二行为一个长度为n的小写字母字符串。
你可以有四种操作：光标左移或右移一个字符；对当前光标所指的字符加一或减一（'z'+1='a'，反之亦然）。
输出一个数字t，表示最少经过t次操作，可以将字符串处理为一个**回文串**。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Nam is playing with a string on his computer. The string consists of $ n $ lowercase English letters. It is meaningless, so Nam decided to make the string more beautiful, that is to make it be a palindrome by using 4 arrow keys: left, right, up, down.
There is a cursor pointing at some symbol of the string. Suppose that cursor is at position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ , the string uses 1-based indexing) now. Left and right arrow keys are used to move cursor around the string. The string is cyclic, that means that when Nam presses left arrow key, the cursor will move to position $ i-1 $ if $ i>1 $ or to the end of the string (i. e. position $ n $ ) otherwise. The same holds when he presses the right arrow key (if $ i=n $ , the cursor appears at the beginning of the string).
When Nam presses up arrow key, the letter which the text cursor is pointing to will change to the next letter in English alphabet (assuming that alphabet is also cyclic, i. e. after 'z' follows 'a'). The same holds when he presses the down arrow key.
Initially, the text cursor is at position $ p $ .
Because Nam has a lot homework to do, he wants to complete this as fast as possible. Can you help him by calculating the minimum number of arrow keys presses to make the string to be a palindrome?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) and $ p $ ( $ 1<=p<=n $ ), the length of Nam's string and the initial position of the text cursor.
The next line contains $ n $ lowercase characters of Nam's string.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of presses needed to change string into a palindrome.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>8 3

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward or reversed.
In the sample test, initial Nam's string is: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF486C/c2c9513e216627ba8dba5e20f24d19bb9e05137a.png) (cursor position is shown bold).
In optimal solution, Nam may do $ 6 $ following steps:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF486C/69c8590618c960ba2fbb8128394f526e54e905cd.png)The result, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF486C/f8fb95d3cc7310b730ff830a0c29f176cf3c201f.png), is now a palindrome.</div>
