<h1>Path Canonization【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A path in some Unix-similar file system is given. The path consists of elements separated with characters "/". For example: "/usr/share/mysql/../tomcat6/conf/server.xml". The path starts with the root directory (i.e. starts with the character "/"). Each element means a name of file or directory, or it is one of two special elements: "." или "..". First of them stands for the current directory (for example, path "/./usr/././share" is equal to "/usr/share"). The second element ".." stands for the moving to the parent directory (for example, path "/usr/share/../lib" is equal to "/usr/lib").
You task is to convert the given path to such a path, which doesn't contain special elements "." and/or "..". If it is impossible, print "-1". The only reason for it is an attempt to move to the parent directory from the root.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains the given path. The path starts with "/" and consists of elements separated with "/". No two "/" follow one after another (consecutively). The only path which can end with "/" is the root directory path equal to "/".
Each element may contain "a"-"z", "0"-"9" and dots. Any element different from specials "." and ".." contains at least one character different from the dots.
The path length is between 1 and 1000 inclusively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the required path or "-1".</div>
