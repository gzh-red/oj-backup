<h1>Blocked Points</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Imagine you have an infinite 2D plane with Cartesian coordinate system. Some of the integral points are blocked, and others are not. Two integral points $ A $ and $ B $ on the plane are 4-connected if and only if:
- the Euclidean distance between $ A $ and $ B $ is one unit and neither $ A $ nor $ B $ is blocked;
- or there is some integral point $ C $ , such that $ A $ is 4-connected with $ C $ , and $ C $ is 4-connected with $ B $ .
Let's assume that the plane doesn't contain blocked points. Consider all the integral points of the plane whose Euclidean distance from the origin is no more than $ n $ , we'll name these points special. Chubby Yang wants to get the following property: no special point is 4-connected to some non-special point. To get the property she can pick some integral points of the plane and make them blocked. What is the minimum number of points she needs to pick?</div>
