<h1>Photo to Remember</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
某一天，n个朋友在一起聚会，他们已经很久没见了，于是他们决定拍照留念。
简单的说，拍照的时候，每个人有一个高度和宽度，第i个的高度和宽度分别是hi和wi。这些人排成一条直线，照片的最小的面积必须包含所有的的人，所以照片的面积是W*H，W是所有人的宽度之和，H是所有人中高度最高的那个人的高度。现在想要知道当第i个人不在照片中的时候，照片的最小面积是多少。
输入
第一行是一个正整数N，表示人的数量。
接下来N行，每行两个整数wi和hi，分别表示每个人的宽度和高度。
数据范围：2<=N<=200000,1<=wi<=10,1<=hi<=1000。
输出
包含b1，b2，b3。。Bn，bi表示第i个人不在照片中的时候，照片的最小面积。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day $ n $ friends met at a party, they hadn't seen each other for a long time and so they decided to make a group photo together.
Simply speaking, the process of taking photos can be described as follows. On the photo, each photographed friend occupies a rectangle of pixels: the $ i $ -th of them occupies the rectangle of width $ w_{i} $ pixels and height $ h_{i} $ pixels. On the group photo everybody stands in a line, thus the minimum pixel size of the photo including all the photographed friends, is $ W×H $ , where $ W $ is the total sum of all widths and $ H $ is the maximum height of all the photographed friends.
As is usually the case, the friends made $ n $ photos — the $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) photo had everybody except for the $ j $ -th friend as he was the photographer.
Print the minimum size of each made photo in pixels.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of friends.
Then $ n $ lines follow: the $ i $ -th line contains information about the $ i $ -th friend. The line contains a pair of integers $ w_{i},h_{i} $ ( $ 1<=w_{i}<=10,1<=h_{i}<=1000 $ ) — the width and height in pixels of the corresponding rectangle.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ space-separated numbers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , where $ b_{i} $ — the total number of pixels on the minimum photo containing all friends expect for the $ i $ -th one.</div>
