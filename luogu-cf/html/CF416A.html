<h1>Guess a number!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个名为“猜数字！”的电视节目。正在聚集人气。整个Berland，老人和年轻人都在观看这个节目。
规则很简单。主持人让参与者通过向自己提问来猜测y。可接受的问题有四种类型：
y大于数字x是真的吗？
y小于数字x是真的吗？
y大于等于数字x是真的吗？
y小于等于数字x是真的吗？
在每个问题上，主持人如实回答，“是”或“否”。
给定问题和答案的顺序，找到符合所有答案标准的y。如果没有这样的y，请打印“不可能”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A TV show called "Guess a number!" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.
The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer $ y $ and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:
- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly larger than number $ x $ ?
- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly smaller than number $ x $ ?
- Is it true that $ y $ is larger than or equal to number $ x $ ?
- Is it true that $ y $ is smaller than or equal to number $ x $ ?
On each question the host answers truthfully, "yes" or "no".
Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of $ y $ that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print "Impossible".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ ) — the number of questions (and answers). Next $ n $ lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: "sign x answer", where the sign is:
- ">" (for the first type queries),
- "<" (for the second type queries),
- ">=" (for the third type queries),
- "<=" (for the fourth type queries).
All values of $ x $ are integer and meet the inequation $ -10^{9}<=x<=10^{9} $ . The answer is an English letter "Y" (for "yes") or "N" (for "no").
Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print any of such integers $ y $ , that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number $ y $ must meet the inequation $ -2·10^{9}<=y<=2·10^{9} $ . If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word "Impossible" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
