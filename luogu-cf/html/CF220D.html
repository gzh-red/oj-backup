<h1>Little Elephant and Triangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Little Elephant is playing with the Cartesian coordinates' system. Most of all he likes playing with integer points. The Little Elephant defines an integer point as a pair of integers $ (x; y) $ , such that $ 0<=x<=w $ and $ 0<=y<=h $ . Thus, the Little Elephant knows only $ (w+1)·(h+1) $ distinct integer points.
The Little Elephant wants to paint a triangle with vertexes at integer points, the triangle's area must be a positive integer. For that, he needs to find the number of groups of three points that form such triangle. At that, the order of points in a group matters, that is, the group of three points $ (0;0) $ , $ (0;2) $ , $ (2;2) $ isn't equal to the group $ (0;2) $ , $ (0;0) $ , $ (2;2) $ .
Help the Little Elephant to find the number of groups of three integer points that form a nondegenerate triangle with integer area.</div>
