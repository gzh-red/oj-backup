<h1>Balanced brackets【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters «+» and «1». For example, sequences «(())()», «()» and «(()(()))» are balanced, while «)(», «(()» and «(()))(» are not.
You are given a string which consists of opening and closing round brackets. Check whether it is a balanced bracket sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of input contains a string between $ 1 $ and $ 100 $ characters long, inclusive. Each character in the string will be «(» or «)».</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
