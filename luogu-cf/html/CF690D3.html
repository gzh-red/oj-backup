<h1>The Wall (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>So many wall designs to choose from! Even modulo $ 10^{6}+3 $ , it's an enormous number. Given that recently Heidi acquired an unlimited supply of bricks, her choices are endless! She really needs to do something to narrow them down.
Heidi is quick to come up with criteria for a useful wall:
- In a useful wall, at least one segment is wider than $ W $ bricks. This should give the zombies something to hit their heads against. Or,
- in a useful wall, at least one column is higher than $ H $ bricks. This provides a lookout from which zombies can be spotted at a distance.
This should rule out a fair amount of possibilities, right? Help Heidi compute the number of useless walls that do not confirm to either of these criteria. In other words, a wall is useless if every segment has width at most $ W $ and height at most $ H $ .
Parameter $ C $ , the total width of the wall, has the same meaning as in the easy version. However, note that the number of bricks is now unlimited.
Output the number of useless walls modulo $ 10^{6}+3 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and the only line of the input contains three space-separated integers $ C $ , $ W $ and $ H $ ( $ 1<=C<=10^{8} $ , $ 1<=W,H<=100 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the number of different walls, modulo $ 10^{6}+3 $ , which are useless according to Heidi's criteria.</div>
