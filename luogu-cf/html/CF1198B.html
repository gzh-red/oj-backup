<h1>Welfare State</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$n$个数，$q$个操作
操作有两种：
``1 p x``：将$p$位置上的数变为$x$
``2 x``：将所有小于$x$的数变为$x$
输出经过$q$次操作后的这$n$个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a country with $ n $ citizens. The $ i $ -th of them initially has $ a_{i} $ money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.
Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than $ x $ are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly $ x $ money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.
You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5} $ ) — the numer of citizens.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_{i} \le 10^{9} $ ) — the initial balances of citizens.
The next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^{5} $ ) — the number of events.
Each of the next $ q $ lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.
Each event is described as either 1 p x ( $ 1 \le p \le n $ , $ 0 \le x \le 10^{9} $ ), or 2 x ( $ 0 \le x \le 10^{9} $ ). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the $ p $ -th person becomes equal to $ x $ . In the second case we have a payoff with parameter $ x $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers — the balances of all citizens after all events.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the balances change as follows: 1 2 3 4 $ \rightarrow $ 3 3 3 4 $ \rightarrow $ 3 2 3 4 $ \rightarrow $ 3 2 3 4
In the second example the balances change as follows: 3 50 2 1 10 $ \rightarrow $ 3 0 2 1 10 $ \rightarrow $ 8 8 8 8 10 $ \rightarrow $ 8 8 20 8 10</div>
