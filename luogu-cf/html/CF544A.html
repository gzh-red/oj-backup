<h1>Set of Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题面】给你一个整数k,一个字符串q,问是否能把字符串q分成k个子串（可不同长度）,并且每个子串首字母不同。
【输入】第一行一个整数k,第二行一个字符串q。
【输出】如果可以，输出YES,并在下面的k行输出任意一种可能方案。如果不可以，输出NO。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ q $ . A sequence of $ k $ strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ is called beautiful, if the concatenation of these strings is string $ q $ (formally, $ s_{1}+s_{2}+...+s_{k}=q $ ) and the first characters of these strings are distinct.
Find any beautiful sequence of strings or determine that the beautiful sequence doesn't exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a positive integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=26 $ ) — the number of strings that should be in a beautiful sequence.
The second line contains string $ q $ , consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is within range from $ 1 $ to $ 100 $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If such sequence doesn't exist, then print in a single line "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes) and in the next $ k $ lines print the beautiful sequence of strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ .
If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.</div>
