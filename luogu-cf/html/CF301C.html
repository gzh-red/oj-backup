<h1>Yaroslav and Algorithm</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Yaroslav likes algorithms. We'll describe one of his favorite algorithms.
1. The algorithm receives a string as the input. We denote this input string as $ a $ .
2. The algorithm consists of some number of command. Сommand number $ i $ looks either as $ s_{i} $ >> $ w_{i} $ , or as $ s_{i} $ <> $ w_{i} $ , where $ s_{i} $ and $ w_{i} $ are some possibly empty strings of length at most $ 7 $ , consisting of digits and characters "?".
3. At each iteration, the algorithm looks for a command with the minimum index $ i $ , such that $ s_{i} $ occurs in $ a $ as a substring. If this command is not found the algorithm terminates.
4. Let's denote the number of the found command as $ k $ . In string $ a $ the first occurrence of the string $ s_{k} $ is replaced by string $ w_{k} $ . If the found command at that had form $ s_{k} $ >> $ w_{k} $ , then the algorithm continues its execution and proceeds to the next iteration. Otherwise, the algorithm terminates.
5. The value of string $ a $ after algorithm termination is considered to be the output of the algorithm.
Yaroslav has a set of $ n $ positive integers, he needs to come up with his favorite algorithm that will increase each of the given numbers by one. More formally, if we consider each number as a string representing the decimal representation of the number, then being run on each of these strings separately, the algorithm should receive the output string that is a recording of the corresponding number increased by one.
Help Yaroslav.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=100) $ — the number of elements in the set. The next $ n $ lines contains one positive integer each. All the given numbers are less than $ 10^{25} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the algorithm which can individually increase each number of the set. In the $ i $ -th line print the command number $ i $ without spaces.
Your algorithm will be launched for each of these numbers. The answer will be considered correct if:
- Each line will a correct algorithm command (see the description in the problem statement).
- The number of commands should not exceed $ 50 $ .
- The algorithm will increase each of the given numbers by one.
- To get a respond, the algorithm will perform no more than $ 200 $ iterations for each number.</div>
