<h1>Good Sequences</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div> 松鼠丽丝对序列很感兴趣，她对整数也有着爱好。它特别喜欢n个她称之为“好整数”的整数：a1,a2,……,an。（会输入）
现在，她对“好序列”很感兴趣。如果一个序列x1,x2,...,xk能够满足一下三个条件，那就是一个“好序列”：
1.该序列是严格上升的，即x[i] < x[i+1]（1<=i<=k-1)
2.任意两个相邻的元素是非互质的，即gcd(x[i],x[i+1]) > 1 (1<=i<=k-1) (gcd即最大公约数）
3.所有的数字都是“好整数”
现在，请你找出长度最长的“好序列”

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ are good.
Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:
- The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. $ x_{i}&lt;x_{i+1} $ for each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=k-1) $ .
- No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. $ gcd(x_{i},x_{i+1})&gt;1 $ for each $ i $ $ (1<=i<=k-1) $ (where $ gcd(p,q) $ denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers $ p $ and $ q $ ).
- All elements of the sequence are good integers.
Find the length of the longest good sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of good integers. The second line contains a single-space separated list of good integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ in strictly increasing order ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5}; a_{i}&lt;a_{i+1} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the length of the longest good sequence.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the following sequences are examples of good sequences: \[2; 4; 6; 9\], \[2; 4; 6\], \[3; 9\], \[6\]. The length of the longest good sequence is 4.</div>
