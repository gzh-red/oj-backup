<h1>Diverse Substring</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为n的字符串，
在字符串中找一段子序列，该子序列满足以下条件：
- 子序列中的任何字母出现次数严格小于子序列长度的一半
- 子序列是原字符串中连续的一部分
- （例如"codeforces","code"满足条件而"fors"不行）
若可以则输出YES，并输出任意一个满足题意的子序列
若找不出任何满足题意的子序列则输出"NO"
- 输入：第一行一个数n
第二行长度为n的一个字符串
- 输出：
如果可以，第一行输出"YES"
第二行输出满足题意的任何子串（注意是任何，没有唯一解）
不行则输出"NO"</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ , consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.
A substring of string $ s $ is a continuous segment of letters from $ s $ . For example, "defor" is a substring of "codeforces" and "fors" is not.
The length of the substring is the number of letters in it.
Let's call some string of length $ n $ diverse if and only if there is no letter to appear strictly more than $ \frac n 2 $ times. For example, strings "abc" and "iltlml" are diverse and strings "aab" and "zz" are not.
Your task is to find any diverse substring of string $ s $ or report that there is none. Note that it is not required to maximize or minimize the length of the resulting substring.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 1000 $ ) — the length of string $ s $ .
The second line is the string $ s $ , consisting of exactly $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "NO" if there is no diverse substring in the string $ s $ .
Otherwise the first line should contain "YES". The second line should contain any diverse substring of string $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>10
codeforces
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
code
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5
aaaaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first example has lots of correct answers.
Please, restrain yourself from asking if some specific answer is correct for some specific test or not, these questions always lead to "No comments" answer.</div>
