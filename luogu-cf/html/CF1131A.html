<h1>Sea Battle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出两个矩形的宽和高$w1,h1,w2,h2$，且已知：
* 第二个矩形在第一个矩形的上面
* 它们的左端对齐
* 矩形彼此相邻而没有间隙
求（八个方向）围绕这两个矩形所组成的图形的方格数 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In order to make the "Sea Battle" game more interesting, Boris decided to add a new ship type to it. The ship consists of two rectangles. The first rectangle has a width of $ w_1 $ and a height of $ h_1 $ , while the second rectangle has a width of $ w_2 $ and a height of $ h_2 $ , where $ w_1 \ge w_2 $ . In this game, exactly one ship is used, made up of two rectangles. There are no other ships on the field.
The rectangles are placed on field in the following way:
- the second rectangle is on top the first rectangle;
- they are aligned to the left, i.e. their left sides are on the same line;
- the rectangles are adjacent to each other without a gap.
See the pictures in the notes: the first rectangle is colored red, the second rectangle is colored blue.
Formally, let's introduce a coordinate system. Then, the leftmost bottom cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $ (1, 1) $ , the rightmost top cell of the first rectangle has coordinates $ (w_1, h_1) $ , the leftmost bottom cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $ (1, h_1 + 1) $ and the rightmost top cell of the second rectangle has coordinates $ (w_2, h_1 + h_2) $ .
After the ship is completely destroyed, all cells neighboring by side or a corner with the ship are marked. Of course, only cells, which don't belong to the ship are marked. On the pictures in the notes such cells are colored green.
Find out how many cells should be marked after the ship is destroyed. The field of the game is infinite in any direction.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Four lines contain integers $ w_1, h_1, w_2 $ and $ h_2 $ ( $ 1 \leq w_1, h_1, w_2, h_2 \leq 10^8 $ , $ w_1 \ge w_2 $ ) — the width of the first rectangle, the height of the first rectangle, the width of the second rectangle and the height of the second rectangle. You can't rotate the rectangles.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly one integer — the number of cells, which should be marked after the ship is destroyed.</div>
