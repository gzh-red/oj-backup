<h1>Median String</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定长度为$k$的字符串$s$和$t$，保证$s$的字典序小于$t$。现有一个字典序单调递增的序列，其中所有的字符串长度都是$k$，字典序满足大于等于$s$且小于等于$t$。求出这个序列位于中间的字符串。
数据保证序列长度是奇数。
例：$k=2$,$s=$"az",$t=$"bf"
序列就会是：[az,ba,bb,bc,bd,be,bf]
中间的字符串是：bc</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two strings $ s $ and $ t $ , both consisting of exactly $ k $ lowercase Latin letters, $ s $ is lexicographically less than $ t $ .
Let's consider list of all strings consisting of exactly $ k $ lowercase Latin letters, lexicographically not less than $ s $ and not greater than $ t $ (including $ s $ and $ t $ ) in lexicographical order. For example, for $ k=2 $ , $ s= $ "az" and $ t= $ "bf" the list will be \["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"\].
Your task is to print the median (the middle element) of this list. For the example above this will be "bc".
It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than $ s $ and not greater than $ t $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the length of strings.
The second line of the input contains one string $ s $ consisting of exactly $ k $ lowercase Latin letters.
The third line of the input contains one string $ t $ consisting of exactly $ k $ lowercase Latin letters.
It is guaranteed that $ s $ is lexicographically less than $ t $ .
It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than $ s $ and not greater than $ t $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one string consisting exactly of $ k $ lowercase Latin letters — the median (the middle element) of list of strings of length $ k $ lexicographically not less than $ s $ and not greater than $ t $ .</div>
