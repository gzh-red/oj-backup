<h1>Neko does Maths</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定两个正整数$a,b$，找到非负整数$k$使$a+k$与$b+k$的最小公倍数最小，如有多解输出最小的$k$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.
Neko has two integers $ a $ and $ b $ . His goal is to find a non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple of $ a+k $ and $ b+k $ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $ k $ , he needs to choose the smallest one.
Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \le a, b \le 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ ( $ k \ge 0 $ ) such that the lowest common multiple of $ a+k $ and $ b+k $ is the smallest possible.
If there are many possible integers $ k $ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test, one should choose $ k = 2 $ , as the least common multiple of $ 6 + 2 $ and $ 10 + 2 $ is $ 24 $ , which is the smallest least common multiple possible.</div>
