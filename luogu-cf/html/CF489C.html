<h1>Given Length and Sum of Digits...</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$ m $和 $ s $，分别找出最大和最小的非负整数，两个数都满足数位长度为$ m $，数位和为$ s $。无解时输出$ -1 $。
$ 1<=m<=100 , 0<=s<=900 $
Translated by @noble_ </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a positive integer $ m $ and a non-negative integer $ s $ . Your task is to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length $ m $ and sum of digits $ s $ . The required numbers should be non-negative integers written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line of the input contains a pair of integers $ m $ , $ s $ ( $ 1<=m<=100,0<=s<=900 $ ) — the length and the sum of the digits of the required numbers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the output print the pair of the required non-negative integer numbers — first the minimum possible number, then — the maximum possible number. If no numbers satisfying conditions required exist, print the pair of numbers "-1 -1" (without the quotes).</div>
