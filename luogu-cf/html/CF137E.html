<h1>Last Chance</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Having read half of the book called "Storm and Calm" on the IT lesson, Innocentius was absolutely determined to finish the book on the maths lessons. All was fine until the math teacher Ms. Watkins saw Innocentius reading fiction books instead of solving equations of the fifth degree. As during the last maths class Innocentius suggested the algorithm of solving equations of the fifth degree in the general case, Ms. Watkins had no other choice but to give him a new task.
The teacher asked to write consecutively (without spaces) all words from the "Storm and Calm" in one long string $ s $ . She thought that a string is good if the number of vowels in the string is no more than twice more than the number of consonants. That is, the string with $ v $ vowels and $ c $ consonants is good if and only if $ v<=2c $ .
The task Innocentius had to solve turned out to be rather simple: he should find the number of the longest good substrings of the string $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only input line contains a non-empty string $ s $ consisting of no more than $ 2·10^{5} $ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. We shall regard letters "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" and their uppercase variants as vowels.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print on a single line two numbers without a space: the maximum length of a good substring and the number of good substrings with this length. If no good substring exists, print "No solution" without the quotes.
Two substrings are considered different if their positions of occurrence are different. So if some string occurs more than once, then it should be counted more than once.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample there is only one longest good substring: "Abo" itself. The other good substrings are "b", "Ab", "bo", but these substrings have shorter length.
In the second sample there is only one longest good substring: "EIS". The other good substrings are: "S", "IS".</div>
