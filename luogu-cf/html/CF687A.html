<h1>NP-Hard Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个无向图，有$n$个结点，$m$条边。现在$cz$和面包要瓜分这个无向图。但是两个人都比较巨，都$AK$了$IOI$，因此他们要求自己必须得到一个原图的点覆盖集（即对于原图的任意一条边，必须至少得到一个边上的结点）。由于他们忙着制作小面包烤绿鸟，因此他们让你来解决这个问题。
注意输出格式：如果有解，第一行输出$cz$得到的点数，第二行依次输出$cz$得到的每一个点，三四行用来描述$main$包的点数和每一个点。如果无解，应当输出-1~~并被二人吊打一顿~~。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting.
Suppose the graph $ G $ is given. Subset $ A $ of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge $ uv $ there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687A/346f03956cdac7458eec43b55228ce8629640261.png) or ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687A/65e661dc0c93081d16f2e3a6dd63015d37b62d35.png) (or both).
Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover.
They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices $ A $ and $ B $ , such that both $ A $ and $ B $ are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=m<=100000 $ ) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the prize graph, respectively.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains a pair of integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ), denoting an undirected edge between $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ . It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it's impossible to split the graph between Pari and Arya as they expect, print "-1" (without quotes).
If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer $ k $ denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains $ k $ integers — the indices of vertices. Note that because of $ m>=1 $ , vertex cover cannot be empty.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, you can give the vertex number $ 2 $ to Arya and vertices numbered $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ to Pari and keep vertex number $ 4 $ for yourself (or give it someone, if you wish).
In the second sample, there is no way to satisfy both Pari and Arya.</div>
