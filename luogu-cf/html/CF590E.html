<h1>Birthday</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>8岁的Dasha 就要生日了，她的每个亲戚都送给了她一条丝带，每个丝带上都有一个问候语。她决定扔掉一些丝带，使剩下的丝带是时尚的。在一个问候语集合中，任何串都不是其他串的子串，则认为这个集合是时尚的。
Dasha 想扔掉尽可能少的丝带，希望你帮她。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today is birthday of a Little Dasha — she is now 8 years old! On this occasion, each of her $ n $ friends and relatives gave her a ribbon with a greeting written on it, and, as it turned out, all the greetings are different. Dasha gathered all the ribbons and decided to throw away some of them in order to make the remaining set stylish. The birthday girl considers a set of ribbons stylish if no greeting written on some ribbon is a substring of another greeting written on some other ribbon. Let us recall that the substring of the string $ s $ is a continuous segment of $ s $ .
Help Dasha to keep as many ribbons as possible, so that she could brag about them to all of her friends. Dasha cannot rotate or flip ribbons, that is, each greeting can be read in a single way given in the input.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=750 $ ) — the number of Dasha's relatives and friends.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains exactly one greeting. Each greeting consists of characters 'a' and 'b' only.
The total length of all greetings won't exceed $ 10000000 $ characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the maximum size of the stylish set. In the second line print the numbers of ribbons involved in it, assuming that they are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in the order they appear in the input. If there are several stylish sets of the maximum size, print any of them.</div>
