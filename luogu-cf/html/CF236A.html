<h1>Boy or Girl</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>那些日子，许多男孩在论坛上使用漂亮女孩的照片作为化身。所以很难在第一眼就知道用户的性别。去年，我们的英雄去了一个论坛，和一位美女聊天（他想是这样）。之后，他们经常交谈，最终他们成为了网络中的一对情侣。
但是昨天，他在现实世界里看到了“她”，发现“她”其实是一个非常强壮的男人！我们的英雄很伤心，他太累了，不能再爱了。因此，他想出了一种通过用户名来识别用户性别的方法。
这是他的方法：如果用户名中的不同字符数是奇数，那么他是男性，否则她是女性。您给出了表示用户名的字符串，请用我们的方法帮助我们的英雄确定这个用户的性别。
翻译提供者：友利奈绪</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.
But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.
This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>wjmzbmr
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>CHAT WITH HER!
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>xiaodao
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>IGNORE HIM!
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>sevenkplus
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>CHAT WITH HER!
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".</div>
