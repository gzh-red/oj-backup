<h1>Preparation for International Women&#039;s Day</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你ｎ个数，两两组成ｋ的倍数。 即，从n个数中每次选两个数，这两个数的和必须为k的倍数。问最多有多少种可能性。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.
There are $ n $ candy boxes in the shop for sale. The $ i $ -th box contains $ d_i $ candies.
Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for $ k $ girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by $ k $ . In other words, two boxes $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ i \ne j $ ) can be combined as a gift if $ d_i + d_j $ is divisible by $ k $ .
How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes "partially" or redistribute candies between them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le k \le 100 $ ) — the number the boxes and the number the girls.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n $ ( $ 1 \le d_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ d_i $ is the number of candies in the $ i $ -th box.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the maximum number of the boxes Polycarp can give as gifts.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes):
- $ (2, 3) $ ;
- $ (5, 6) $ ;
- $ (1, 4) $ .
So the answer is $ 6 $ .
In the second example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes):
- $ (6, 8) $ ;
- $ (2, 3) $ ;
- $ (1, 4) $ ;
- $ (5, 7) $ .
So the answer is $ 8 $ .
In the third example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes):
- $ (1, 2) $ ;
- $ (6, 7) $ .
So the answer is $ 4 $ .</div>
