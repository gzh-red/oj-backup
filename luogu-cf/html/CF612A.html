<h1>The Text Splitting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given the string $ s $ of length $ n $ and the numbers $ p,q $ . Split the string $ s $ to pieces of length $ p $ and $ q $ .
For example, the string "Hello" for $ p=2 $ , $ q=3 $ can be split to the two strings "Hel" and "lo" or to the two strings "He" and "llo".
Note it is allowed to split the string $ s $ to the strings only of length $ p $ or to the strings only of length $ q $ (see the second sample test).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three positive integers $ n,p,q $ ( $ 1<=p,q<=n<=100 $ ).
The second line contains the string $ s $ consists of lowercase and uppercase latin letters and digits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it's impossible to split the string $ s $ to the strings of length $ p $ and $ q $ print the only number "-1".
Otherwise in the first line print integer $ k $ — the number of strings in partition of $ s $ .
Each of the next $ k $ lines should contain the strings in partition. Each string should be of the length $ p $ or $ q $ . The string should be in order of their appearing in string $ s $ — from left to right.
If there are several solutions print any of them.</div>
