<h1>Three displays</h1>

<div>**题目大意：**
$n$个位置，每个位置有两个属性$s,c$，要求选择3个位置$i,j,k$，使得$s_i<s_j<s_k$，并使得$c_i+c_j+c_k$最小 **输入格式：** 一行一个整数，$n$，$3<=n<=3000$ 一行$n$个整数，即$s$ 再一行$n$个整数，即$c$ **输出格式：** 输出一个整数，即最小的c_i+c_j+c_k 感谢@守望 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is the middle of 2018 and Maria Stepanovna, who lives outside Krasnokamensk (a town in Zabaikalsky region), wants to rent three displays to highlight an important problem.
There are $ n $ displays placed along a road, and the $ i $ -th of them can display a text with font size $ s_i $ only. Maria Stepanovna wants to rent such three displays with indices $ i < j < k $ that the font size increases if you move along the road in a particular direction. Namely, the condition $ s_i < s_j < s_k $ should be held.
The rent cost is for the $ i $ -th display is $ c_i $ . Please determine the smallest cost Maria Stepanovna should pay.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \le n \le 3\,000 $ ) — the number of displays.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n $ ( $ 1 \le s_i \le 10^9 $ ) — the font sizes on the displays in the order they stand along the road.
The third line contains $ n $ integers $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n $ ( $ 1 \le c_i \le 10^8 $ ) — the rent costs for each display.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there are no three displays that satisfy the criteria, print -1. Otherwise print a single integer — the minimum total rent cost of three displays with indices $ i < j < k $ such that $ s_i < s_j < s_k $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you can, for example, choose displays $ 1 $ , $ 4 $ and $ 5 $ , because $ s_1 < s_4 < s_5 $ ( $ 2 < 4 < 10 $ ), and the rent cost is $ 40 + 10 + 40 = 90 $ .
In the second example you can't select a valid triple of indices, so the answer is -1.</div>
