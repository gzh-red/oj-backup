<h1>Problem About Equation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有N个杯子和一个瓶子,要把瓶子里的水倒进那N个杯子里,使N个杯子里的水量相等(瓶子里的水也必须倒完).
输入:
第一行两个整数N(杯子个数),B(瓶子里的水量)
后面N个数表示每个杯子里原有的水量.
输出:
N个浮点数,表示每个杯子里加多少水,才能使每个杯子里水量相等,且瓶子里的水**刚好**倒完</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A group of $ n $ merry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of the $ n $ mugs must be the same.
Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug has $ a_{1} $ milliliters of the drink, the second one has $ a_{2} $ milliliters and so on. The bottle has $ b $ milliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.
Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously:
- there were $ b $ milliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;
- after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a pair of integers $ n $ , $ b $ ( $ 2<=n<=100,1<=b<=100 $ ), where $ n $ is the total number of friends in the group and $ b $ is the current volume of drink in the bottle. The second line contains a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=100 $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the current volume of drink in the $ i $ -th mug.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number "-1" (without the quotes), if there is no solution. Otherwise, print $ n $ float numbers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ , where $ c_{i} $ is the volume of the drink to add in the $ i $ -th mug. Print the numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point, print each $ c_{i} $ on a single line. Polycarpus proved that if a solution exists then it is unique.
Russian locale is installed by default on the testing computer. Make sure that your solution use the point to separate the integer part of a real number from the decimal, not a comma.</div>
