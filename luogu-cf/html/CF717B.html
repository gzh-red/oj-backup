<h1>R3D3’s Summer Adventure</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>R3D3 spent some time on an internship in MDCS. After earning enough money, he decided to go on a holiday somewhere far, far away. He enjoyed suntanning, drinking alcohol-free cocktails and going to concerts of popular local bands. While listening to "The White Buttons" and their hit song "Dacan the Baker", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.
There are $ n $ letters in R3D3’s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter’s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet’s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help.
Given the costs $ c_{0} $ and $ c_{1} $ for each '0' and '1' in R3D3’s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains three integers $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{8} $ ), $ c_{0} $ and $ c_{1} $ ( $ 0<=c_{0},c_{1}<=10^{8} $ ) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 1 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>12
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There are $ 4 $ letters in the alphabet. The optimal encoding is "00", "01", "10", "11". There are $ 4 $ zeroes and $ 4 $ ones used, so the total cost is $ 4·1+4·2=12 $ .</div>
