<h1>Reversing Encryption</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A string $ s $ of length $ n $ can be encrypted by the following algorithm:
- iterate over all divisors of $ n $ in decreasing order (i.e. from $ n $ to $ 1 $ ),
- for each divisor $ d $ , reverse the substring $ s[1 \dots d] $ (i.e. the substring which starts at position $ 1 $ and ends at position $ d $ ).
For example, the above algorithm applied to the string $ s $ ="codeforces" leads to the following changes: "codeforces" $ \to $ "secrofedoc" $ \to $ "orcesfedoc" $ \to $ "rocesfedoc" $ \to $ "rocesfedoc" (obviously, the last reverse operation doesn't change the string because $ d=1 $ ).
You are given the encrypted string $ t $ . Your task is to decrypt this string, i.e., to find a string $ s $ such that the above algorithm results in string $ t $ . It can be proven that this string $ s $ always exists and is unique.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input consists of a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the length of the string $ t $ . The second line of input consists of the string $ t $ . The length of $ t $ is $ n $ , and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a string $ s $ such that the above algorithm results in $ t $ .</div>
