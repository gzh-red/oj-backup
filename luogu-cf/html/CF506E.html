<h1>Mr. Kitayuta&#039;s Gift</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个仅含小写字母的字符串s，你需要在s中插入n个字符（任意小写字母均可），每个字符可以被插在任意位置。问可以得到多少种本质不同的回文串。答案对10007取模。
|s|≤200,n≤10^9</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mr. Kitayuta has kindly given you a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase English letters. You are asked to insert exactly $ n $ lowercase English letters into $ s $ to make it a palindrome. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "noon", "testset" and "a" are all palindromes, while "test" and "kitayuta" are not.) You can choose any $ n $ lowercase English letters, and insert each of them to any position of $ s $ , possibly to the beginning or the end of $ s $ . You have to insert exactly $ n $ letters even if it is possible to turn $ s $ into a palindrome by inserting less than $ n $ letters.
Find the number of the palindromes that can be obtained in this way, modulo $ 10007 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=200 $ ). Each character in $ s $ is a lowercase English letter.
The second line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of the palindromes that can be obtained, modulo $ 10007 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>revive

</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, you can obtain the palindrome "reviver" by inserting 'r' to the end of "revive".
For the second sample, the following 28 palindromes can be obtained: "adada", "adbda", ..., "adzda", "dadad" and "ddadd".</div>
