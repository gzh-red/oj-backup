<h1>Line</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一条直线：Ax+By+C=0（AB不同时为0），找到任意一个点（在-5e18~5e18之间）让它的横纵坐标均为整数，或者确定没有这样的点。
输入：A，B，C
输出：该点坐标，没有就输出-1</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A line on the plane is described by an equation $ Ax+By+C=0 $ . You are to find any point on this line, whose coordinates are integer numbers from $ -5·10^{18} $ to $ 5·10^{18} $ inclusive, or to find out that such points do not exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ ( $ -2·10^{9}<=A,B,C<=2·10^{9} $ ) — corresponding coefficients of the line equation. It is guaranteed that $ A^{2}+B^{2}>0 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the required point exists, output its coordinates, otherwise output -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
