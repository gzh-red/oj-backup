<h1>Maximum Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个数列和m，在数列任选若干个数，使得他们的和对m取模后最大
Translated by @xzyxzy </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integers, and additionally an integer $ m $ . You have to choose some sequence of indices $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{k} $ ( $ 1<=b_{1}&lt;b_{2}&lt;...&lt;b_{k}<=n $ ) in such a way that the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF888E/3a3d2e76b5bca3303d7d35912be232a5cadb1203.png) is maximized. Chosen sequence can be empty.
Print the maximum possible value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF888E/3a3d2e76b5bca3303d7d35912be232a5cadb1203.png).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you can choose a sequence $ b={1,2} $ , so the sum ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF888E/08d6750b1b23699a8b513ddd01c316f10e6a789c.png) is equal to $ 7 $ (and that's $ 3 $ after taking it modulo $ 4 $ ).
In the second example you can choose a sequence $ b={3} $ .</div>
