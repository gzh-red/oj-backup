<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个含有n个元素的数列，第i号元素开始时数值为i,元素i可以与距离为d[i]的元素进行交换。再给定一个1-n的全排列，问初始的数列可否交换成给定的样式。
输入:第一行一个整数n，第二行n个互不相同的整数表示目标数列，第三行n个整数表示d[i];
输出:如果能交换到给定样式，输出"YES"，否则输出"NO"。
1<=n<=100

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day $ n $ cells of some array decided to play the following game. Initially each cell contains a number which is equal to it's ordinal number (starting from $ 1 $ ). Also each cell determined it's favourite number. On it's move $ i $ -th cell can exchange it's value with the value of some other $ j $ -th cell, if $ |i-j|=d_{i} $ , where $ d_{i} $ is a favourite number of $ i $ -th cell. Cells make moves in any order, the number of moves is unlimited.
The favourite number of each cell will be given to you. You will also be given a permutation of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . You are to determine whether the game could move to this state.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains positive integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of cells in the array. The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ — permutation. The last line contains $ n $ integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ — favourite numbers of the cells.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the given state is reachable in the described game, output YES, otherwise NO.</div>
