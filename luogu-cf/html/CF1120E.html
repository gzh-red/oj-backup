<h1>The very same Munchhausen</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A positive integer $ a $ is given. Baron Munchausen claims that he knows such a positive integer $ n $ that if one multiplies $ n $ by $ a $ , the sum of its digits decreases $ a $ times. In other words, $ S(an) = S(n)/a $ , where $ S(x) $ denotes the sum of digits of the number $ x $ .
Find out if what Baron told can be true.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains a single integer $ a $ ( $ 2 \le a \le 10^3 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no such number $ n $ , print $ -1 $ .
Otherwise print any appropriate positive integer $ n $ . Your number must not consist of more than $ 5\cdot10^5 $ digits. We can show that under given constraints either there is no answer, or there is an answer no longer than $ 5\cdot10^5 $ digits.</div>
