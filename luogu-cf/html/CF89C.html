<h1>Chip Play</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's consider the following game. We have a rectangular field $ n×m $ in size. Some squares of the field contain chips.
Each chip has an arrow painted on it. Thus, each chip on the field points in one of the following directions: up, down, left or right.
The player may choose a chip and make a move with it.
The move is the following sequence of actions. The chosen chip is marked as the current one. After that the player checks whether there are more chips in the same row (or in the same column) with the current one that are pointed by the arrow on the current chip. If there is at least one chip then the closest of them is marked as the new current chip and the former current chip is removed from the field. After that the check is repeated. This process can be repeated several times. If a new chip is not found, then the current chip is removed from the field and the player's move ends.
By the end of a move the player receives several points equal to the number of the deleted chips.
By the given initial chip arrangement determine the maximum number of points that a player can receive during one move. Also determine the number of such moves.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m,n×m<=5000 $ ). Then follow $ n $ lines containing $ m $ characters each — that is the game field description. "." means that this square is empty. "L", "R", "U", "D" mean that this square contains a chip and an arrow on it says left, right, up or down correspondingly.
It is guaranteed that a field has at least one chip.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two numbers — the maximal number of points a player can get after a move and the number of moves that allow receiving this maximum number of points.</div>

<div>In the first sample the maximum number of points is earned by the chip in the position $ (3,3) $ . You can see its progress at the following picture:
