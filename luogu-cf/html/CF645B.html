<h1>Mischievous Mess Makers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个长度为$n$的排列，从$1\sim n$（即$1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots$），给定交换次数$k$，要求使用**小于等于**$k$次交换使得逆序对数量最多，最多的逆序对数量。

有一个长度为$n$的排列，从$1\sim n$（即$1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots$），给定交换次数$k$，要求使用**小于等于**$k$次交换使得逆序对数量最多，最多的逆序对数量。
```</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is a balmy spring afternoon, and Farmer John's $ n $ cows are ruminating about link-cut cacti in their stalls. The cows, labeled $ 1 $ through $ n $ , are arranged so that the $ i $ -th cow occupies the $ i $ -th stall from the left. However, Elsie, after realizing that she will forever live in the shadows beyond Bessie's limelight, has formed the Mischievous Mess Makers and is plotting to disrupt this beautiful pastoral rhythm. While Farmer John takes his $ k $ minute long nap, Elsie and the Mess Makers plan to repeatedly choose two distinct stalls and swap the cows occupying those stalls, making no more than one swap each minute.
Being the meticulous pranksters that they are, the Mischievous Mess Makers would like to know the maximum messiness attainable in the $ k $ minutes that they have. We denote as $ p_{i} $ the label of the cow in the $ i $ -th stall. The messiness of an arrangement of cows is defined as the number of pairs $ (i,j) $ such that $ i&lt;j $ and $ p_{i}&gt;p_{j} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=100000 $ ) — the number of cows and the length of Farmer John's nap, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer, the maximum messiness that the Mischievous Mess Makers can achieve by performing no more than $ k $ swaps.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the Mischievous Mess Makers can swap the cows in the stalls $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ during the first minute, then the cows in stalls $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ during the second minute. This reverses the arrangement of cows, giving us a total messiness of $ 10 $ .
In the second sample, there is only one cow, so the maximum possible messiness is $ 0 $ .</div>
