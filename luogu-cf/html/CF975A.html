<h1>Aramic script</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In Aramic language words can only represent objects.
Words in Aramic have special properties:
- A word is a root if it does not contain the same letter more than once.
- A root and all its permutations represent the same object.
- The root $ x $ of a word $ y $ is the word that contains all letters that appear in $ y $ in a way that each letter appears once. For example, the root of "aaaa", "aa", "aaa" is "a", the root of "aabb", "bab", "baabb", "ab" is "ab".
- Any word in Aramic represents the same object as its root.
You have an ancient script in Aramic. What is the number of different objects mentioned in the script?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 $ ) — the number of words in the script.
The second line contains $ n $ words $ s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n $ — the script itself. The length of each string does not exceed $ 10^3 $ .
It is guaranteed that all characters of the strings are small latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer — the number of different objects mentioned in the given ancient Aramic script.</div>
