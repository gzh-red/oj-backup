<h1>Points on the line</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意： 给你n个数，要使最大值与最小值之差小于等于d，最少应该删除几个数。
输入格式： 第一行n和d
第二行为输入的数

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.
The diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset $ {1,3,2,1} $ is 2.
Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.
You are given $ n $ points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed $ d $ ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=n<=100,0<=d<=100 $ ) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.
The second line contains $ n $ space separated integers ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=100 $ ) — the coordinates of the points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate $ 4 $ . The remaining points will have coordinates $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , so the diameter will be equal to $ 2-1=1 $ .
In the second test case the diameter is equal to $ 0 $ , so its is unnecessary to remove any points.
In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates $ 1 $ , $ 9 $ and $ 10 $ . The remaining points will have coordinates $ 3 $ , $ 4 $ and $ 6 $ , so the diameter will be equal to $ 6-3=3 $ .</div>
