<h1>Game of the Rows</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在有k个队，飞机有n排座位，每排能做8个人，不同队伍的人不能坐相邻的位置。
相邻情况有5种（1，2）（3，4）（4，5）（5，6）（7，8）这n排座位是否够坐。
（k个队的总人数小于8*n）
输入：
第一行为输入数据的组数case ( 1=<case <=20 ) 每组数据共两行 第一行包含两个数 N,K 分别表示飞机有N排座位，有K个队伍 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) 第二行 有k个数字，a[1]……a[k],a[i]表示第i个队伍有a[i]人. 其中 a[1]+a[2]+……a[K]<=8*N; 输出： 每组数据，判断这n排座位够坐，输出”YES”,否则输出”NO” </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Daenerys Targaryen has an army consisting of $ k $ groups of soldiers, the $ i $ -th group contains $ a_{i} $ soldiers. She wants to bring her army to the other side of the sea to get the Iron Throne. She has recently bought an airplane to carry her army through the sea. The airplane has $ n $ rows, each of them has $ 8 $ seats. We call two seats neighbor, if they are in the same row and in seats $ {1,2} $ , $ {3,4} $ , $ {4,5} $ , $ {5,6} $ or $ {7,8} $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF839B/a5775ca3d2acbe5eb291ff1539c245d1482a78a7.png)A row in the airplaneDaenerys Targaryen wants to place her army in the plane so that there are no two soldiers from different groups sitting on neighboring seats.
Your task is to determine if there is a possible arranging of her army in the airplane such that the condition above is satisfied.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ , $ 1<=k<=100 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of groups of soldiers, respectively.
The second line contains $ k $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{k} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10000 $ ), where $ a_{i} $ denotes the number of soldiers in the $ i $ -th group.
It is guaranteed that $ a_{1}+a_{2}+...+a_{k}<=8·n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If we can place the soldiers in the airplane print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).
You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Daenerys can place the soldiers like in the figure below:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF839B/4f29f17cd8b262dbbb92c8d293341e1fb0bc27b8.png)In the second sample, there is no way to place the soldiers in the plane since the second group soldier will always have a seat neighboring to someone from the first group.
In the third example Daenerys can place the first group on seats $ (1,2,7,8) $ , and the second group an all the remaining seats.
In the fourth example she can place the first two groups on seats $ (1,2) $ and $ (7,8) $ , the third group on seats $ (3) $ , and the fourth group on seats $ (5,6) $ .</div>
