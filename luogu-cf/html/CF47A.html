<h1>Triangular numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数n，问你是否存在一个整数i，满足i*(i+1)/2=n。
若存在，输出"YES",否则输出"NO".
1<=n<=500
Translated by @稀神探女</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A triangular number is the number of dots in an equilateral triangle uniformly filled with dots. For example, three dots can be arranged in a triangle; thus three is a triangular number. The $ n $ -th triangular number is the number of dots in a triangle with $ n $ dots on a side. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF47A/7344b4fd5acb7c973775cffc0c5a51a81c6ee4d9.png). You can learn more about these numbers from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular\_number).
Your task is to find out if a given integer is a triangular number.</div>
