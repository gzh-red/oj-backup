<h1>Sereja and Brackets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
有一个字符串，仅由左括号和右括号组成。 有m次查询，每次给你一段区间，问你该字符串在这段区间中的字串的所有子序列中，满足左右括号互相匹配的合法子序列最长的长度是多少
（字串：在原串中直接截取 子序列：任两个之间可以不相邻，但顺序不能改变）
数据范围：字符串长度<=1000000，询问次数<=100000，字符串第一位的下标为1
感谢@orz_lzt 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja has a bracket sequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ , or, in other words, a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of characters "(" and ")".
Sereja needs to answer $ m $ queries, each of them is described by two integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n) $ . The answer to the $ i $ -th query is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence $ s_{li},s_{li}+1,...,s_{ri} $ . Help Sereja answer all queries.
You can find the definitions for a subsequence and a correct bracket sequence in the notes.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a sequence of characters $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ $ (1<=n<=10^{6}) $ without any spaces. Each character is either a "(" or a ")". The second line contains integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=10^{5}) $ — the number of queries. Each of the next $ m $ lines contains a pair of integers. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ l_{i},r_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n) $ — the description of the $ i $ -th query.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A subsequence of length $ |x| $ of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ (where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) is string $ x=s_{k1}s_{k2}...\ s_{k|x|} $ $ (1<=k_{1}<k_{2}<...<k_{|x|}<=|s|) $ . A correct bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct aryphmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the characters of the string. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are correct (the resulting expressions "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not. For the third query required sequence will be «()». For the fourth query required sequence will be «()(())(())».</div>
