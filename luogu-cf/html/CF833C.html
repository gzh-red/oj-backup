<h1>Ever-Hungry Krakozyabra</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF833C/c33d858fd2851e05374522a30a7adabbf702fc1e.png)Recently, a wild Krakozyabra appeared at Jelly Castle. It is, truth to be said, always eager to have something for dinner.
Its favorite meal is natural numbers (typically served with honey sauce), or, to be more precise, the zeros in their corresponding decimal representations. As for other digits, Krakozyabra dislikes them; moreover, they often cause it indigestion! So, as a necessary precaution, Krakozyabra prefers to sort the digits of a number in non-descending order before proceeding to feast. Then, the leading zeros of the resulting number are eaten and the remaining part is discarded as an inedible tail.
For example, if Krakozyabra is to have the number $ 57040 $ for dinner, its inedible tail would be the number $ 457 $ .
Slastyona is not really fond of the idea of Krakozyabra living in her castle. Hovewer, her natural hospitality prevents her from leaving her guest without food. Slastyona has a range of natural numbers from $ L $ to $ R $ , which she is going to feed the guest with. Help her determine how many distinct inedible tails are going to be discarded by Krakozyabra by the end of the dinner.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only string, the numbers $ L $ and $ R $ are given – the boundaries of the range $ (1<=L<=R<=10^{18}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the sole number – the answer for the problem.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, the inedible tails are the numbers from $ 1 $ to $ 9 $ . Note that $ 10 $ and $ 1 $ have the same inedible tail – the number $ 1 $ .
In the second sample case, each number has a unique inedible tail, except for the pair $ 45,54 $ . The answer to this sample case is going to be $ (57-40+1)-1=17 $ .</div>
