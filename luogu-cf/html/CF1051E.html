<h1>Vasya and Big Integers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya owns three big integers — $ a, l, r $ . Let's define a partition of $ x $ such a sequence of strings $ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k $ that $ s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_k = x $ , where $ + $ is a concatanation of strings. $ s_i $ is the $ i $ -th element of the partition. For example, number $ 12345 $ has the following partitions: \["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"\], \["123", "4", "5"\], \["1", "2345"\], \["12345"\] and lots of others.
Let's call some partition of $ a $ beautiful if each of its elements contains no leading zeros.
Vasya want to know the number of beautiful partitions of number $ a $ , which has each of $ s_i $ satisfy the condition $ l \le s_i \le r $ . Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.
Help Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number $ a $ such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ a~(1 \le a \le 10^{1000000}) $ .
The second line contains a single integer $ l~(0 \le l \le 10^{1000000}) $ .
The third line contains a single integer $ r~(0 \le r \le 10^{1000000}) $ .
It is guaranteed that $ l \le r $ .
It is also guaranteed that numbers $ a, l, r $ contain no leading zeros.</div>
