<h1>Ehab and subtraction</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为n的序列a[]，要求做m次操作
一次操作定义为，从序列中找出最小的正整数，记为x，并令序列中所有不为0的数减去x，并输出这个x
如果序列中全是0那么输出0
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You're given an array $ a $ . You should repeat the following operation $ k $ times: find the minimum non-zero element in the array, print it, and then subtract it from all the non-zero elements of the array. If all the elements are 0s, just print 0.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1 \le n,k \le 10^5) $ , the length of the array and the number of operations you should perform.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ $ (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) $ , the elements of the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum non-zero element before each operation in a new line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 5
1 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
1
1
0
0
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 2
10 3 5 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3
2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample:
In the first step: the array is $ [1,2,3] $ , so the minimum non-zero element is 1.
In the second step: the array is $ [0,1,2] $ , so the minimum non-zero element is 1.
In the third step: the array is $ [0,0,1] $ , so the minimum non-zero element is 1.
In the fourth and fifth step: the array is $ [0,0,0] $ , so we printed 0.
In the second sample:
In the first step: the array is $ [10,3,5,3] $ , so the minimum non-zero element is 3.
In the second step: the array is $ [7,0,2,0] $ , so the minimum non-zero element is 2.</div>
