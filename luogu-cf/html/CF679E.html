<h1>Bear and Bad Powers of 42</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个序列，要求你完成以下三个操作：
1.输出A[i]
2.将[a,b]区间的所有数字变成c
3.将[a,b]区间的每个数加上c，若此时区间内有42的整次幂(1,42,422,423,424...)，则一直进行此操作，直到区间内没有这类数；</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Limak, a bear, isn't good at handling queries. So, he asks you to do it.
We say that powers of $ 42 $ (numbers $ 1,42,1764,... $ ) are bad. Other numbers are good.
You are given a sequence of $ n $ good integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ . Your task is to handle $ q $ queries of three types:
1. 1 i — print $ t_{i} $ in a separate line.
2. 2 a b x — for ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF679E/410ca2de5f51b6a4a070685e9aced96067224755.png) set $ t_{i} $ to $ x $ . It's guaranteed that $ x $ is a good number.
3. 3 a b x — for ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF679E/410ca2de5f51b6a4a070685e9aced96067224755.png) increase $ t_{i} $ by $ x $ . After this repeat the process while at least one $ t_{i} $ is bad.
You can note that after each query all $ t_{i} $ are good.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n,q<=100000 $ ) — the size of Limak's sequence and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 2<=t_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — initial elements of Limak's sequence. All $ t_{i} $ are good.
Then, $ q $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th of them describes the $ i $ -th query. The first number in the line is an integer $ type_{i} $ ( $ 1<=type_{i}<=3 $ ) — the type of the query. There is at least one query of the first type, so the output won't be empty.
In queries of the second and the third type there is $ 1<=a<=b<=n $ .
In queries of the second type an integer $ x $ ( $ 2<=x<=10^{9} $ ) is guaranteed to be good.
In queries of the third type an integer $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=10^{9} $ ) may be bad.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of the first type, print the answer in a separate line.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>After a query 3 2 4 42 the sequence is $ 40,1742,49,1714,4,1722 $ .
After a query 3 2 6 50 the sequence is $ 40,1842,149,1814,104,1822 $ .
After a query 2 3 4 41 the sequence is $ 40,1842,41,41,104,1822 $ .
After a query 3 1 5 1 the sequence is $ 43,1845,44,44,107,1822 $ .</div>
