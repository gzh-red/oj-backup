<h1>Sums of Digits</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya had a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $ a_{1} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ . Vasya used it to build a new sequence $ b_{1} $ , ..., $ b_{n} $ , where $ b_{i} $ is the sum of digits of $ a_{i} $ 's decimal representation. Then sequence $ a_{i} $ got lost and all that remained is sequence $ b_{i} $ .
Vasya wonders what the numbers $ a_{i} $ could be like. Of all the possible options he likes the one sequence with the minimum possible last number $ a_{n} $ . Help Vasya restore the initial sequence.
It is guaranteed that such a sequence always exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=300 $ ).
Next $ n $ lines contain integer numbers $ b_{1} $ , ..., $ b_{n} $ — the required sums of digits. All $ b_{i} $ belong to the range $ 1<=b_{i}<=300 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integer numbers, one per line — the correct option for numbers $ a_{i} $ , in order of following in sequence. The sequence should be strictly increasing. The sum of digits of the $ i $ -th number should be equal to $ b_{i} $ .
If there are multiple sequences with least possible number $ a_{n} $ , print any of them. Print the numbers without leading zeroes.</div>
