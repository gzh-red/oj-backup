<h1>Fly, freebies, fly!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数列a，一个整数m，求在数列a中在[x,x+m]内最多整数的数量</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everyone loves a freebie. Especially students.
It is well-known that if in the night before exam a student opens window, opens the student's record-book and shouts loudly three times "Fly, freebie, fly!" — then flown freebie helps him to pass the upcoming exam.
In the night before the exam on mathematical analysis $ n $ students living in dormitory shouted treasured words. The $ i $ -th student made a sacrament at the time $ t_{i} $ , where $ t_{i} $ is the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the night.
It is known that the freebie is a capricious and willful lady. That night the freebie was near dormitory only for $ T $ seconds. Therefore, if for two students their sacrament times differ for more than $ T $ , then the freebie didn't visit at least one of them.
Since all students are optimists, they really want to know what is the maximal number of students visited by the freebie can be.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ), where $ n $ — the number of students shouted "Fly, freebie, fly!" The second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ t_{i} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=1000 $ ).
The last line contains integer $ T $ ( $ 1<=T<=1000 $ ) — the time interval during which the freebie was near the dormitory.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
