<h1>Stones</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目简述：
你有三堆石子，分别有a,b,c个，每次你可以有两个操作：
1:从第一堆取1个，第二堆取2个
2：从第二堆取1个，第三堆取2个
最后最多可以得到多少个石子</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice is playing with some stones.
Now there are three numbered heaps of stones. The first of them contains $ a $ stones, the second of them contains $ b $ stones and the third of them contains $ c $ stones.
Each time she can do one of two operations:
1. take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap (this operation can be done only if the first heap contains at least one stone and the second heap contains at least two stones);
2. take one stone from the second heap and two stones from the third heap (this operation can be done only if the second heap contains at least one stone and the third heap contains at least two stones).
She wants to get the maximum number of stones, but she doesn't know what to do. Initially, she has $ 0 $ stones. Can you help her?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) — the number of test cases. Next $ t $ lines describe test cases in the following format:
Line contains three non-negative integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ , separated by spaces ( $ 0 \leq a,b,c \leq 100 $ ) — the number of stones in the first, the second and the third heap, respectively.
In hacks it is allowed to use only one test case in the input, so $ t = 1 $ should be satisfied.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ t $ lines, the answers to the test cases in the same order as in the input. The answer to the test case is the integer — the maximum possible number of stones that Alice can take after making some operations.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first test case in the first test, Alice can take two stones from the second heap and four stones from the third heap, making the second operation two times. Then she can take one stone from the first heap and two stones from the second heap, making the first operation one time. The summary number of stones, that Alice will take is $ 9 $ . It is impossible to make some operations to take more than $ 9 $ stones, so the answer is $ 9 $ .</div>
