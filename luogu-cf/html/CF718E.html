<h1>Matvey&#039;s Birthday</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Matvey是一个可爱的女孩子，他刚刚悄悄地对你说了一个可爱的字符串.
这个长度为n的可爱的字符串SS只包含′a′−′h′'a'-'h'′a′−′h′八种字符。你可以根据它来画出一张无向图.
无向图含有n个结点，编号为0 到n−1..结点i与结点j间有边相连当且仅当$|i-j|=1$或 $S[i]=S[j]$。
如果你求出来了这个无向图的直径和有多少对点间的最短距离与直径相同，就能接收到Matvey的爱啦！
PS：(求点对数,不是路径条数)
无向图的直径指的是所有节点两两间的最短路径中的最大值.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today is Matvey's birthday. He never knows what to ask as a present so friends gave him a string $ s $ of length $ n $ . This string consists of only first eight English letters: 'a', 'b', $ ... $ , 'h'.
First question that comes to mind is: who might ever need some string? Matvey is a special boy so he instantly found what to do with this string. He used it to build an undirected graph where vertices correspond to position in the string and there is an edge between distinct positions $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=n $ ) if at least one of the following conditions hold:
1. $ a $ and $ b $ are neighbouring, i.e. $ |a-b|=1 $ .
2. Positions $ a $ and $ b $ contain equal characters, i.e. $ s_{a}=s_{b} $ .
Then Matvey decided to find the diameter of this graph. Diameter is a maximum distance (length of the shortest path) among all pairs of vertices. Also, Matvey wants to find the number of pairs of vertices such that the distance between them is equal to the diameter of the graph. As he is very cool and experienced programmer he managed to solve this problem very fast. Will you do the same?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100000 $ ) — the length of the string.
The second line contains the string $ s $ itself. It's guaranteed that $ s $ consists of only first eight letters of English alphabet.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers — the diameter of the graph and the number of pairs of positions with the distance equal to the diameter.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the second sample.
The maximum distance is $ 2 $ . It's obtained for pairs $ (1,4) $ , $ (2,4) $ , $ (4,6) $ and $ (4,7) $ .</div>
