<h1>Watchmen</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目简述：**
给出n (1<=n<=200000) 对坐标(xi,yi) (|xi|,|yi|<=10^9) 。求问曼哈顿距离和欧氏距离相等的坐标组(i,j)(1<=i<j<=n)有多少对？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are $ n $ watchmen on a plane, the $ i $ -th watchman is located at point $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ .
They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen $ i $ and $ j $ to be $ |x_{i}-x_{j}|+|y_{i}-y_{j}| $ . Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF650A/fcefde1ea60e1105aa698e148af7dc900a7454c9.png).
The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs $ (i,j) $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ ), such that the distance between watchman $ i $ and watchmen $ j $ calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains the single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of watchmen.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ |x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{9} $ ).
Some positions may coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the distance between watchman $ 1 $ and watchman $ 2 $ is equal to $ |1-7|+|1-5|=10 $ for Doctor Manhattan and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF650A/91477f866a0e0d69e03fe1418359568f2f96b567.png) for Daniel. For pairs $ (1,1) $ , $ (1,5) $ and $ (7,5) $ , $ (1,5) $ Doctor Manhattan and Daniel will calculate the same distances.</div>
