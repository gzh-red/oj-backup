<h1>Diversity</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个字符串$S$与一个整数$k$。
你可以更改$S$中的任意字符，使得字符串$S$中有不小于$k$个不同的字符。
求最少的更改次数。
$1\le k \le 26, 1\le |S|\le 1000.$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Calculate the minimum number of characters you need to change in the string $ s $ , so that it contains at least $ k $ different letters, or print that it is impossible.
String $ s $ consists only of lowercase Latin letters, and it is allowed to change characters only to lowercase Latin letters too.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains string $ s $ , consisting only of lowercase Latin letters ( $ 1<=|s|<=1000 $ , $ |s| $ denotes the length of $ s $ ).
Second line of input contains integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=26 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print single line with a minimum number of necessary changes, or the word «impossible» (without quotes) if it is impossible.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case string contains $ 6 $ different letters, so we don't need to change anything.
In the second test case string contains $ 4 $ different letters: $ {'a','h','o','y'} $ . To get $ 5 $ different letters it is necessary to change one occurrence of $ 'o' $ to some letter, which doesn't occur in the string, for example, $ {'b'} $ .
In the third test case, it is impossible to make $ 7 $ different letters because the length of the string is $ 6 $ .</div>
