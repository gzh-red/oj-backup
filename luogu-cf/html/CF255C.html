<h1>Almost Arithmetical Progression</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:
- $ a_{1}=p $ , where $ p $ is some integer;
- $ a_{i}=a_{i-1}+(-1)^{i+1}·q $ $ (i&gt;1) $ , where $ q $ is some integer.
Right now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence $ b $ , consisting of $ n $ integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.
Sequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ is a subsequence of sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , if there is such increasing sequence of indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...\ &lt;i_{k}<=n) $ , that $ b_{ij}=s_{j} $ . In other words, sequence $ s $ can be obtained from $ b $ by crossing out some elements.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=4000) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=10^{6}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the length of the required longest subsequence.</div>
