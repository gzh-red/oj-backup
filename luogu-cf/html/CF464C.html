<h1>Substitutes in Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Andrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string $ s $ , consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type " $ d_{i}→t_{i} $ ", that means "replace all digits $ d_{i} $ in string $ s $ with substrings equal to $ t_{i} $ ". For example, if $ s=123123 $ , then query " $ 2→00 $ " transforms $ s $ to $ 10031003 $ , and query " $ 3→ $ " ("replace 3 by an empty string") transforms it to $ s=1212 $ . After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to $ s $ by $ 1000000007 (10^{9}+7) $ . When you represent $ s $ as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if $ s $ is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.
Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=10^{5} $ ), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.
The second line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of queries.
The next $ n $ lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The $ i $ -th query is described by string " $ d_{i} $ -> $ t_{i} $ ", where $ d_{i} $ is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), $ t_{i} $ is a string consisting of digits ( $ t_{i} $ can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of $ t_{i} $ for all queries doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ . The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by $ 1000000007 (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
