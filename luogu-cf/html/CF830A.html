<h1>Office Keys</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在一条直线上有n人和k个钥匙。每个人都想到达位于线路上的办公室。要做到这一点，他需要到一个有钥匙的点上，拿到钥匙然后去办公室。
1. 一旦有人拿走钥匙，任何人都不能拿走钥匙。
2. 人们每1秒移动一个单位距离。
您需要确定所有人用钥匙到达办公室的最短时间。 如果两个人同时拿到钥匙，他们中只有一个可以拿钥匙。而一个人只能通过那个点而不能获取钥匙。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ people and $ k $ keys on a straight line. Every person wants to get to the office which is located on the line as well. To do that, he needs to reach some point with a key, take the key and then go to the office. Once a key is taken by somebody, it couldn't be taken by anybody else.
You are to determine the minimum time needed for all $ n $ people to get to the office with keys. Assume that people move a unit distance per $ 1 $ second. If two people reach a key at the same time, only one of them can take the key. A person can pass through a point with a key without taking it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ p $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ n<=k<=2000 $ , $ 1<=p<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of people, the number of keys and the office location.
The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — positions in which people are located initially. The positions are given in arbitrary order.
The third line contains $ k $ distinct integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{k} $ ( $ 1<=b_{j}<=10^{9} $ ) — positions of the keys. The positions are given in arbitrary order.
Note that there can't be more than one person or more than one key in the same point. A person and a key can be located in the same point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum time (in seconds) needed for all $ n $ to reach the office with keys.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the person located at point $ 20 $ should take the key located at point $ 40 $ and go with it to the office located at point $ 50 $ . He spends $ 30 $ seconds. The person located at point $ 100 $ can take the key located at point $ 80 $ and go to the office with it. He spends $ 50 $ seconds. Thus, after $ 50 $ seconds everybody is in office with keys.</div>
