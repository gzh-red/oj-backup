<h1>Planar Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A graph is called planar, if it can be drawn in such a way that its edges intersect only at their vertexes.
An articulation point is such a vertex of an undirected graph, that when removed increases the number of connected components of the graph.
A bridge is such an edge of an undirected graph, that when removed increases the number of connected components of the graph.
You've got a connected undirected planar graph consisting of $ n $ vertexes, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , drawn on the plane. The graph has no bridges, articulation points, loops and multiple edges. You are also given $ q $ queries. Each query is a cycle in the graph. The query response is the number of graph vertexes, which (if you draw a graph and the cycle on the plane) are located either inside the cycle, or on it. Write a program that, given the graph and the queries, will answer each query.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3<=n,m<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertexes and edges of the graph. Next $ m $ lines contain the edges of the graph: the $ i $ -th line contains two space-separated integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) — the numbers of vertexes, connecting the $ i $ -th edge. The next $ n $ lines contain the positions of the planar graph vertexes on the plane: the $ i $ -th line contains a pair of space-separated integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ |x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{9}) $ — the coordinates of the $ i $ -th vertex of the graph on the plane.
The next line contains integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of queries. Then follow $ q $ lines that describe the queries: the $ i $ -th line contains the sequence of space-separated integers $ k_{i} $ , $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{ki} $ ( $ 1<=a_{j}<=n; k_{i}&gt;2 $ ), where $ k_{i} $ is the cycle length in the $ i $ -th query, $ a_{j} $ are numbers of the vertexes that form a cycle. The numbers of vertexes in the cycle are given in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. The given cycles are simple, that is they cannot go through a graph vertex more than once. The total length of all cycles in all queries does not exceed $ 10^{5} $ .
It is guaranteed that the given graph contains no bridges, articulation points, loops and multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the edge segments can have common points only at the graph's vertexes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print a single integer — the number of vertexes inside the cycle or on it. Print the answers in the order, in which the queries follow in the input. Separate the numbers by spaces.</div>
