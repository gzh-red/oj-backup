<h1>Roman and Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>将n(n<=10^18)的各位数字重新排列（不允许有前导零） 求 可以构造几个mod m等于0的数字
提供者：@zhoutb2333</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Roman is a young mathematician, very famous in Uzhland. Unfortunately, Sereja doesn't think so. To make Sereja change his mind, Roman is ready to solve any mathematical problem. After some thought, Sereja asked Roma to find, how many numbers are close to number $ n $ , modulo $ m $ .
Number $ x $ is considered close to number $ n $ modulo $ m $ , if:
- it can be obtained by rearranging the digits of number $ n $ ,
- it doesn't have any leading zeroes,
- the remainder after dividing number $ x $ by $ m $ equals 0.
Roman is a good mathematician, but the number of such numbers is too huge for him. So he asks you to help him.</div>
