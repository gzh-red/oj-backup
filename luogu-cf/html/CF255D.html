<h1>Mr. Bender and Square</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个n*n的正方形，给出（x，y）的点，每秒
可以向外扩散（x+1,y） (x-1,y) (x,y+1)
(x,y-1),求需要多少秒才能大于或等于面积C</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mr. Bender has a digital table of size $ n×n $ , each cell can be switched on or off. He wants the field to have at least $ c $ switched on squares. When this condition is fulfilled, Mr Bender will be happy.
We'll consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to $ n $ , and the columns — numbered from left to right from 1 to $ n $ . Initially there is exactly one switched on cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ ( $ x $ is the row number, $ y $ is the column number), and all other cells are switched off. Then each second we switch on the cells that are off but have the side-adjacent cells that are on.
For a cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ the side-adjacent cells are cells with coordinates $ (x-1,y) $ , $ (x+1,y) $ , $ (x,y-1) $ , $ (x,y+1) $ .
In how many seconds will Mr. Bender get happy?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n,x,y,c $ $ (1<=n,c<=10^{9}; 1<=x,y<=n; c<=n^{2}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6 4 3 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9 3 8 10
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Initially the first test has one painted cell, so the answer is 0. In the second test all events will go as is shown on the figure. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF255D/b709c1aa5b91b7af907cf3f3ca10b895a1b76650.png).</div>
