<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在一个$2\times N$的矩阵$A$中，每个格子都是小写字母，你需要在矩阵中找到一条不重复路径，使得经过的字母连起来恰好是长度为一个字符串$S$。（起点、终点任意）。
你只能向左、向右、向下或向上走，求这样的路径有多少种？
由于答案可能很大，所以你只需要输出答案对$10^9+7$的取模值即可。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Oleg Petrov loves crossword puzzles and every Thursday he buys his favorite magazine with crosswords and other word puzzles. In the last magazine Oleg found a curious puzzle, and the magazine promised a valuable prize for it's solution. We give a formal description of the problem below.
The puzzle field consists of two rows, each row contains $ n $ cells. Each cell contains exactly one small English letter. You also are given a word $ w $ , which consists of $ k $ small English letters. A solution of the puzzle is a sequence of field cells $ c_{1} $ , $ ... $ , $ c_{k} $ , such that:
- For all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k $ the letter written in the cell $ c_{i} $ matches the letter $ w_{i} $ ;
- All the cells in the sequence are pairwise distinct;
- For all $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k-1 $ cells $ c_{i} $ and $ c_{i+1} $ have a common side.
Oleg Petrov quickly found a solution for the puzzle. Now he wonders, how many distinct solutions are there for this puzzle. Oleg Petrov doesn't like too large numbers, so calculate the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
Two solutions $ c_{i} $ and $ c'_{i} $ are considered distinct if the sequences of cells do not match in at least one position, that is there is such $ j $ in range from $ 1 $ to $ k $ , such that $ c_{j}≠c'_{j} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first two lines contain the state of the field for the puzzle. Each of these non-empty lines contains exactly $ n $ small English letters.
The next line is left empty.
The next line is non-empty and contains word $ w $ , consisting of small English letters.
The length of each line doesn't exceed $ 2000 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of distinct solutions for the puzzle modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
