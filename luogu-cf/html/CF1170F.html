<h1>Wheels</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**本题仅允许使用`kotlin`提交**
`NaCly_Fish`有$n$个轮子，和一个有$m$个轮子槽的车，每一个轮子有初始压力值$a_i$。
她想要选$m$个轮子，并且这些轮子的压力值相同。
当然她并不是不能对轮子进行操作，每次操作她可以选择一个轮子，并把它的压力值加一或者减一。
由于`NaCly_Fish`是可爱的小姐姐，所以她的力气很小，一共只能将压力值增加最多$k$次。
你需要告诉`NaCly_Fish`她最少需要几次操作才能满足她的愿望。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp has $ n $ wheels and a car with $ m $ slots for wheels. The initial pressure in the $ i $ -th wheel is $ a_i $ .
Polycarp's goal is to take exactly $ m $ wheels among the given $ n $ wheels and equalize the pressure in them (then he can put these wheels in a car and use it for driving). In one minute he can decrease or increase the pressure in any (single) wheel by $ 1 $ . He can increase the pressure no more than $ k $ times in total because it is hard to pump up wheels.
Help Polycarp and say what is the minimum number of minutes he needs to spend to equalize the pressure of at least $ m $ wheels among the given $ n $ wheels.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n, m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 0 \le k \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of wheels, the number of slots for wheels in a car and the number of times Polycarp can increase by $ 1 $ the pressure in a wheel.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the pressure in the $ i $ -th wheel.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum number of minutes Polycarp needs to spend to equalize the pressure in at least $ m $ wheels among the given $ n $ wheels.</div>
