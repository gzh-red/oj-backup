<h1>Watermelon</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>判断输入的正整数能否分成两个正偶数，能则输出YES，不能则输出NO</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed $ w $ kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.
Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first (and the only) input line contains integer number $ w $ ( $ 1<=w<=100 $ ) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>8
