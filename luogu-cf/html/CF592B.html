<h1>The Monster and the Squirrel</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ari the monster always wakes up very early with the first ray of the sun and the first thing she does is feeding her squirrel.
Ari draws a regular convex polygon on the floor and numbers it's vertices $ 1,2,...,n $ in clockwise order. Then starting from the vertex $ 1 $ she draws a ray in the direction of each other vertex. The ray stops when it reaches a vertex or intersects with another ray drawn before. Ari repeats this process for vertex $ 2,3,...,n $ (in this particular order). And then she puts a walnut in each region inside the polygon.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF592B/d684226c6afbbf2809548ec3b0c2067be095c4af.png)Ada the squirrel wants to collect all the walnuts, but she is not allowed to step on the lines drawn by Ari. That means Ada have to perform a small jump if she wants to go from one region to another. Ada can jump from one region P to another region Q if and only if P and Q share a side or a corner.
Assuming that Ada starts from outside of the picture, what is the minimum number of jumps she has to perform in order to collect all the walnuts?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=54321 $ ) - the number of vertices of the regular polygon drawn by Ari.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum number of jumps Ada should make to collect all the walnuts. Note, that she doesn't need to leave the polygon after.</div>
