<h1>Bracket Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A bracket sequence is a string, containing only characters "(", ")", "\[" and "\]".
A correct bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()\[\]", "(\[\])" are correct (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+\[1\]", "(\[1+1\]+1)"), and "\](" and "\[" are not. The empty string is a correct bracket sequence by definition.
A substring $ s[l...\ r] $ $ (1<=l<=r<=|s|) $ of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ (where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) is the string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...\ s_{r} $ . The empty string is a substring of any string by definition.
You are given a bracket sequence, not necessarily correct. Find its substring which is a correct bracket sequence and contains as many opening square brackets «\[» as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and the only line contains the bracket sequence as a string, consisting only of characters "(", ")", "\[" and "\]". It is guaranteed that the string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print a single integer — the number of brackets «\[» in the required bracket sequence. In the second line print the optimal sequence. If there are more than one optimal solutions print any of them.</div>
