<h1>Weak Memory</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个包含n个节点和m条边的无向图，每走一条边都需要花费1点能量。有k个特殊点，每经过一个特殊点都可以将当前能量值补充到能量上限。给定起点s和终点t，求可从点s到达点t的最小能量上限。（保证关键点位置不同且s点必为关键点）
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Zart PMP is qualified for ICPC World Finals in Harbin, China. After team excursion to Sun Island Park for snow sculpture art exposition, PMP should get back to buses before they leave. But the park is really big and he does not know how to find them.
The park has $ n $ intersections numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ . There are $ m $ bidirectional roads that connect some pairs of these intersections. At $ k $ intersections, ICPC volunteers are helping the teams and showing them the way to their destinations. Locations of volunteers are fixed and distinct.
When PMP asks a volunteer the way to bus station, he/she can tell him the whole path. But the park is fully covered with ice and snow and everywhere looks almost the same. So PMP can only memorize at most $ q $ intersections after each question (excluding the intersection they are currently standing). He always tells volunteers about his weak memory and if there is no direct path of length (in number of roads) at most $ q $ that leads to bus station, the volunteer will guide PMP to another volunteer (who is at most $ q $ intersections away, of course). ICPC volunteers know the area very well and always tell PMP the best way. So if there exists a way to bus stations, PMP will definitely find it.
PMP's initial location is intersection $ s $ and the buses are at intersection $ t $ . There will always be a volunteer at intersection $ s $ . Your job is to find out the minimum $ q $ which guarantees that PMP can find the buses.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n,m,k $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},0<=m<=2·10^{5},1<=k<=n $ ) — the number of intersections, roads and volunteers, respectively. Next line contains $ k $ distinct space-separated integers between $ 1 $ and $ n $ inclusive — the numbers of cities where volunteers are located.
Next $ m $ lines describe the roads. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $ u_{i},v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}≠v_{i} $ ) — two intersections that $ i $ -th road connects. There will be at most one road between any two intersections.
Last line of input contains two space-separated integers $ s,t $ ( $ 1<=s,t<=n,s≠t $ ) — the initial location of PMP and the location of the buses. It might not always be possible to reach $ t $ from $ s $ .
It is guaranteed that there is always a volunteer at intersection $ s $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print on the only line the answer to the problem — the minimum value of $ q $ which guarantees that PMP can find the buses. If PMP cannot reach the buses at all, output -1 instead.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first sample is illustrated below. Blue intersections are where volunteers are located. If PMP goes in the path of dashed line, it can reach the buses with $ q=3 $ :
