<h1>2Char</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个单词,你要从里面选一些单词,使得这些单词仅由两种小写字母组成,输出选出单词总长度的最大值.
翻译贡献者：Fuko_Ibuki</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Andrew often reads articles in his favorite magazine 2Char. The main feature of these articles is that each of them uses at most two distinct letters. Andrew decided to send an article to the magazine, but as he hasn't written any article, he just decided to take a random one from magazine 26Char. However, before sending it to the magazine 2Char, he needs to adapt the text to the format of the journal. To do so, he removes some words from the chosen article, in such a way that the remaining text can be written using no more than two distinct letters.
Since the payment depends from the number of non-space characters in the article, Andrew wants to keep the words with the maximum total length.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of words in the article chosen by Andrew. Following are $ n $ lines, each of them contains one word. All the words consist only of small English letters and their total length doesn't exceed $ 1000 $ . The words are not guaranteed to be distinct, in this case you are allowed to use a word in the article as many times as it appears in the input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible total length of words in Andrew's article.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
abb
cacc
aaa
bbb
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>9</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5
a
a
bcbcb
cdecdecdecdecdecde
aaaa
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the optimal way to choose words is {'abb', 'aaa', 'bbb'}.
In the second sample the word 'cdecdecdecdecdecde' consists of three distinct letters, and thus cannot be used in the article. The optimal answer is {'a', 'a', 'aaaa'}.</div>
