<h1>The table</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$Harry Potter$ 的家庭作业超级难。老师给定了一个矩形表，由 $n×m$ 个单元格组成。表中的每个单元格都包含一个整数。
$Harry$ 可以使用两个法术：
第一个法术可以在选定行中改变所有整数的符号
第二个可以在所选列中做同样的事情。
$Harry$ 的任务是用这些咒语把每行和每列中的数字的总和变成非负的。帮帮这个年轻的魔术师，否则他就会挂科，失去和马尔福的拌嘴机会！</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Harry Potter has a difficult homework. Given a rectangular table, consisting of $ n×m $ cells. Each cell of the table contains the integer. Harry knows how to use two spells: the first spell change the sign of the integers in the selected row, the second — in the selected column. Harry's task is to make non-negative the sum of the numbers in each row and each column using these spells.
Alone, the boy can not cope. Help the young magician!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n, m<=100) $ — the number of rows and the number of columns.
Next $ n $ lines follow, each contains $ m $ integers: $ j $ -th integer in the $ i $ -th line is $ a_{i,j} $ $ (|a_{i,j}|<=100) $ , the number in the $ i $ -th row and $ j $ -th column of the table.
The rows of the table numbered from 1 to $ n $ . The columns of the table numbered from 1 to $ m $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print the number $ a $ — the number of required applications of the first spell. Next print $ a $ space-separated integers — the row numbers, you want to apply a spell. These row numbers must be distinct!
In the second line print the number $ b $ — the number of required applications of the second spell. Next print $ b $ space-separated integers — the column numbers, you want to apply a spell. These column numbers must be distinct!
If there are several solutions are allowed to print any of them.</div>
