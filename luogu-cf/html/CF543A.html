<h1>Writing Code</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有 n 个程序员，每个程序员可以写若干行代码，第 i 个程序员每行里会
有 ai 个 bug，现在要完成一个恰好 m 行的代码且总 bug 数量不能超过
b，求有多少种完成方案。两种方案不同当且仅当某个程序员在两种方
案中完成的行数不同。答案模大质数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Programmers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly $ m $ lines of code. There are $ n $ programmers working on a project, the $ i $ -th of them makes exactly $ a_{i} $ bugs in every line of code that he writes.
Let's call a sequence of non-negative integers $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n} $ a plan, if $ v_{1}+v_{2}+...+v_{n}=m $ . The programmers follow the plan like that: in the beginning the first programmer writes the first $ v_{1} $ lines of the given task, then the second programmer writes $ v_{2} $ more lines of the given task, and so on. In the end, the last programmer writes the remaining lines of the code. Let's call a plan good, if all the written lines of the task contain at most $ b $ bugs in total.
Your task is to determine how many distinct good plans are there. As the number of plans can be large, print the remainder of this number modulo given positive integer $ mod $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ b $ , $ mod $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=500 $ , $ 0<=b<=500 $ ; $ 1<=mod<=10^{9}+7 $ ) — the number of programmers, the number of lines of code in the task, the maximum total number of bugs respectively and the modulo you should use when printing the answer.
The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=500 $ ) — the number of bugs per line for each programmer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo $ mod $ .</div>
