<h1>Beaver Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>两只海狸（Timur and Marsel）做游戏
什么游戏呢？
有n条长度为m的木棍
从Timur开始，每只海狸轮流将一根已有的木棍任意等分
但要保证等分后的每一段长度都是不小于k的整数
（m,n，k为小于等于1000000000的正整数）
先无法等分的海狸输
已知Timur and Marsel,无比聪明，智商碾压人类（真可怕），这导致他们每一步都最优
那聪明的你，能不能告诉更聪明的评测机，到底谁会获胜呢？

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two beavers, Timur and Marsel, play the following game.
There are $ n $ logs, each of exactly $ m $ meters in length. The beavers move in turns. For each move a beaver chooses a log and gnaws it into some number (more than one) of equal parts, the length of each one is expressed by an integer and is no less than $ k $ meters. Each resulting part is also a log which can be gnawed in future by any beaver. The beaver that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other beaver wins.
Timur makes the first move. The players play in the optimal way. Determine the winner.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Timur", if Timur wins, or "Marsel", if Marsel wins. You should print everything without the quotes.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 15 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Timur</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 9 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Marsel</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the beavers only have one log, of $ 15 $ meters in length. Timur moves first. The only move he can do is to split the log into $ 3 $ parts each $ 5 $ meters in length. Then Marsel moves but he can't split any of the resulting logs, as $ k=4 $ . Thus, the winner is Timur.
In the second example the beavers have $ 4 $ logs $ 9 $ meters in length. Timur can't split any of them, so that the resulting parts possessed the length of not less than $ 5 $ meters, that's why he loses instantly.</div>
