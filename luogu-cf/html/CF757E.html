<h1>Bash Plays with Functions</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义函数$f_r(n)$在r=0时为整数对(p,q)满足p*q=n且gcd(p,q)=1的有序对(p,q)个数,在$r\ge1$时$f_r(n)=\sum_{u*v=n}\frac{f_{r-1}(u)+f_{r-1}(v)}{2}$
​
一共q组询问, 每组询问给出r,n,求$f_r(n)$模 10^9+7的结果.
$q\le10^6$,$0\le r\le10^6$,$1\le n\le10^6$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bash got tired on his journey to become the greatest Pokemon master. So he decides to take a break and play with functions.
Bash defines a function $ f_{0}(n) $ , which denotes the number of ways of factoring $ n $ into two factors $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ . In other words, $ f_{0}(n) $ is the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $ (p,q) $ such that $ p·q=n $ and $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ .
But Bash felt that it was too easy to calculate this function. So he defined a series of functions, where $ f_{r+1} $ is defined as:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757E/ba3f455e23406140b1481185211a534c2e0f9d49.png)Where $ (u,v) $ is any ordered pair of positive integers, they need not to be co-prime.
Now Bash wants to know the value of $ f_{r}(n) $ for different $ r $ and $ n $ . Since the value could be huge, he would like to know the value modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . Help him!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{6} $ ) — the number of values Bash wants to know.
Each of the next $ q $ lines contain two integers $ r $ and $ n $ ( $ 0<=r<=10^{6} $ , $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ), which denote Bash wants to know the value $ f_{r}(n) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ q $ integers. For each pair of $ r $ and $ n $ given, print $ f_{r}(n) $ modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ on a separate line.</div>
