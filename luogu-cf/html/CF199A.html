<h1>Hexadecimal&#039;s theorem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一斐波那契数列：
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, ...
现输入一个斐波那契数，将其拆分为三个斐波那契数输出，每两个数中隔一个空格。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently, a chaotic virus Hexadecimal advanced a new theorem which will shake the Universe. She thinks that each Fibonacci number can be represented as sum of three not necessary different Fibonacci numbers.
Let's remember how Fibonacci numbers can be calculated. $ F_{0}=0 $ , $ F_{1}=1 $ , and all the next numbers are $ F_{i}=F_{i-2}+F_{i-1} $ .
So, Fibonacci numbers make a sequence of numbers: $ 0 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 8 $ , $ 13 $ , ...
If you haven't run away from the PC in fear, you have to help the virus. Your task is to divide given Fibonacci number $ n $ by three not necessary different Fibonacci numbers or say that it is impossible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains of a single integer $ n $ $ (0<=n&lt;10^{9}) $ — the number that should be represented by the rules described above. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is a Fibonacci number.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output three required numbers: $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ . If there is no answer for the test you have to print "I'm too stupid to solve this problem" without the quotes.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
