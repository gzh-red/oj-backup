<h1>Heidi Learns Hashing (Easy)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>简单来说，它先给你一个二元二次方程的解出来的值，这个二元方程就是H(x, y) = x^2+2xy+x+1，让你求它是否有解。如果有解，则输出x在最小值下x和y分别的值。如果没有解则输出No。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Melody Pond was stolen from her parents as a newborn baby by Madame Kovarian, to become a weapon of the Silence in their crusade against the Doctor. Madame Kovarian changed Melody's name to River Song, giving her a new identity that allowed her to kill the Eleventh Doctor.
Heidi figured out that Madame Kovarian uses a very complicated hashing function in order to change the names of the babies she steals. In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques.
The first hashing function she designed is as follows.
Given two positive integers $ (x, y) $ she defines $ H(x,y):=x^2+2xy+x+1 $ .
Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer $ r $ , can you find a pair $ (x, y) $ (of positive integers) such that $ H(x, y) = r $ ?
If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible $ x $ . If there is no such pair, output "NO".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains an integer $ r $ ( $ 1 \le r \le 10^{12} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output integers $ x, y $ such that $ H(x,y) = r $ and $ x $ is smallest possible, or "NO" if no such pair exists.</div>
