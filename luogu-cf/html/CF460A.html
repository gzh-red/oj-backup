<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has $ n $ pairs of socks. In the morning of each day Vasya has to put on a pair of socks before he goes to school. When he comes home in the evening, Vasya takes off the used socks and throws them away. Every $ m $ -th day (at days with numbers $ m,2m,3m,... $ ) mom buys a pair of socks to Vasya. She does it late in the evening, so that Vasya cannot put on a new pair of socks before the next day. How many consecutive days pass until Vasya runs out of socks?</div>

<div>The single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n<=100; 2<=m<=100) $ , separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
