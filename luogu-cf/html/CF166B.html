<h1>Polygons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n$个点的凸多边形$A$和$m$个点的凸多边形$B$,(方向可能为顺/逆时针).
判断$B$是否完全被$A$包含,且不能有交点. </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got another geometrical task. You are given two non-degenerate polygons $ A $ and $ B $ as vertex coordinates. Polygon $ A $ is strictly convex. Polygon $ B $ is an arbitrary polygon without any self-intersections and self-touches. The vertices of both polygons are given in the clockwise order. For each polygon no three consecutively following vertices are located on the same straight line.
Your task is to check whether polygon $ B $ is positioned strictly inside polygon $ A $ . It means that any point of polygon $ B $ should be strictly inside polygon $ A $ . "Strictly" means that the vertex of polygon $ B $ cannot lie on the side of the polygon $ A $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the only integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices of polygon $ A $ . Then $ n $ lines contain pairs of integers $ x_{i},y_{i} $ ( $ |x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{9} $ ) — coordinates of the $ i $ -th vertex of polygon $ A $ . The vertices are given in the clockwise order.
The next line contains a single integer $ m $ ( $ 3<=m<=2·10^{4} $ ) — the number of vertices of polygon $ B $ . Then following $ m $ lines contain pairs of integers $ x_{j},y_{j} $ ( $ |x_{j}|,|y_{j}|<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the $ j $ -th vertex of polygon $ B $ . The vertices are given in the clockwise order.
The coordinates of the polygon's vertices are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that polygons $ A $ and $ B $ are non-degenerate, that polygon $ A $ is strictly convex, that polygon $ B $ has no self-intersections and self-touches and also for each polygon no three consecutively following vertices are located on the same straight line.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print on the only line the answer to the problem — if polygon $ B $ is strictly inside polygon $ A $ , print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
