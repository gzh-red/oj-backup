<h1>Captain Marmot</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>土拨鼠上尉想准备一场对他的敌人蛇上尉的重大战斗。在这场战斗中，他有N个团，每个团由4个鼹鼠组成。
最初，每只小鼠i（1<=i<=4n 1<=i<=4n）被放置在笛卡尔平面的某个位置（x i，y i）。如果可能的话，土拨鼠上尉想移动一些鼹鼠，使兵团紧凑。
每一个鼹鼠我都有一个家在这个位置（a_i，b_i）。一次移动这个鼹鼠意味着将他的位置点（x_i，y_i）围绕它的原点（a_i，b_i）逆时针旋转90度，
只有当四只老鼠的位置点形成一个非零面积的正方形时，一个团才是紧凑的。
如果可能的话，帮助土拨鼠上尉为每个团找出使该团紧凑所需的最少移动次数。
【输出】：对于每一个询问输出一行，为最小移动次数，如果不能，则输出‘-1’</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Captain Marmot wants to prepare a huge and important battle against his enemy, Captain Snake. For this battle he has $ n $ regiments, each consisting of $ 4 $ moles.
Initially, each mole $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=4n $ ) is placed at some position $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ in the Cartesian plane. Captain Marmot wants to move some moles to make the regiments compact, if it's possible.
Each mole $ i $ has a home placed at the position $ (a_{i},b_{i}) $ . Moving this mole one time means rotating his position point $ (x_{i},y_{i}) $ $ 90 $ degrees counter-clockwise around it's home point $ (a_{i},b_{i}) $ .
A regiment is compact only if the position points of the $ 4 $ moles form a square with non-zero area.
Help Captain Marmot to find out for each regiment the minimal number of moves required to make that regiment compact, if it's possible.</div>

<div>In the first regiment we can move once the second or the third mole.
We can't make the second regiment compact.
In the third regiment, from the last $ 3 $ moles we can move once one and twice another one.
In the fourth regiment, we can move twice the first mole and once the third mole.</div>
