<h1>Vasya and Triangle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$1 \le n,m \le 10^9$，$2 \le k \le 10^9$，求出三个点$A(x_1,y_1),B(x_2,y_2),C(x_3,y_3)$，满足：
1. $0 \le x_1,x_2,x_3 \le n$，$0 \le y_1,y_2,y_3 \le m$
1. $S_{\Delta}ABC=\frac{nm}{k}$
若无解则直接输出`NO`，否则第一行输出`YES`，接下来的三行为三个点的坐标。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has got three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ . He'd like to find three integer points $ (x_1, y_1) $ , $ (x_2, y_2) $ , $ (x_3, y_3) $ , such that $ 0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n $ , $ 0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m $ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $ \frac{nm}{k} $ .
Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1\le n, m \le 10^9 $ , $ 2 \le k \le 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there are no such points, print "NO".
Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $ x_i, y_i $ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $ \frac{nm}{k} = 4 $ . The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:
