<h1>Down the Hatch!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>参加烧烤的n个人围成一圈，因此每个人都有一个特殊的 编bi 从0 ~ n-1
编号为0 的人 （这一轮的0号人是VASYA）开始游戏。游戏的次数计作j次（j>=1），如果第j次是从 编号 bi者开始的，那么这个就要这样做：
1-他（这个编号 bi 者）用手肘指着、或者对那个 编号为 (bi+1)%n 的家伙点头。
2-如果j大于等于4 ，那么j-1 j-2 j-3轮的玩家，在轮到他们的期间进行和bi玩家在现轮一样的动作，然后bi就要 喝一杯果汁。（感谢冰清玉洁小朋友对这句话的翻译）
3-下一回游戏是 编号为 （bi+1）%n 开始。
现在问题是，vasya 已经喝了太多果汁，但不记得他喝了几杯。
然而，vasya已经知道 所有玩家（包括他自己）的动作顺序。现在他想得出，如果他想玩的特别好喝到最多的果汁，并且别人的动作都不变，他该怎么做？帮帮他
输入：
参与者数量n
如果玩家第j次用手肘指着下一个人，第j个字母等于a。
如果玩家第j次用对下一个人点头，第j个字母等于b。
J的范围是（1~2000）
输出：在他玩的特别好的情况下 vasaya最多能喝几杯饮料</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everybody knows that the Berland citizens are keen on health, especially students. Berland students are so tough that all they drink is orange juice!
Yesterday one student, Vasya and his mates made some barbecue and they drank this healthy drink only. After they ran out of the first barrel of juice, they decided to play a simple game. All $ n $ people who came to the barbecue sat in a circle (thus each person received a unique index $ b_{i} $ from 0 to $ n-1 $ ). The person number 0 started the game (this time it was Vasya). All turns in the game were numbered by integers starting from 1. If the $ j $ -th turn was made by the person with index $ b_{i} $ , then this person acted like that:
1. he pointed at the person with index $ (b_{i}+1) mod n $ either with an elbow or with a nod ( $ x mod y $ is the remainder after dividing $ x $ by $ y $ );
2. if $ j>=4 $ and the players who had turns number $ j-1 $ , $ j-2 $ , $ j-3 $ , made during their turns the same moves as player $ b_{i} $ on the current turn, then he had drunk a glass of juice;
3. the turn went to person number $ (b_{i}+1) mod n $ .
The person who was pointed on the last turn did not make any actions.
The problem was, Vasya's drunk too much juice and can't remember the goal of the game. However, Vasya's got the recorded sequence of all the participants' actions (including himself). Now Vasya wants to find out the maximum amount of juice he could drink if he played optimally well (the other players' actions do not change). Help him.
You can assume that in any scenario, there is enough juice for everybody.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 4<=n<=2000 $ ) — the number of participants in the game. The second line describes the actual game: the $ i $ -th character of this line equals 'a', if the participant who moved $ i $ -th pointed at the next person with his elbow, and 'b', if the participant pointed with a nod. The game continued for at least 1 and at most $ 2000 $ turns.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of glasses of juice Vasya could have drunk if he had played optimally well.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In both samples Vasya has got two turns — 1 and 5. In the first sample, Vasya could have drunk a glass of juice during the fifth turn if he had pointed at the next person with a nod. In this case, the sequence of moves would look like "abbbb". In the second sample Vasya wouldn't drink a single glass of juice as the moves performed during turns 3 and 4 are different.</div>
