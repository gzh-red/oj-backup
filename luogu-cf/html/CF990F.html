<h1>Flow Control</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have to handle a very complex water distribution system. The system consists of $ n $ junctions and $ m $ pipes, $ i $ -th pipe connects junctions $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ .
The only thing you can do is adjusting the pipes. You have to choose $ m $ integer numbers $ f_1 $ , $ f_2 $ , ..., $ f_m $ and use them as pipe settings. $ i $ -th pipe will distribute $ f_i $ units of water per second from junction $ x_i $ to junction $ y_i $ (if $ f_i $ is negative, then the pipe will distribute $ |f_i| $ units of water per second from junction $ y_i $ to junction $ x_i $ ). It is allowed to set $ f_i $ to any integer from $ -2 \cdot 10^9 $ to $ 2 \cdot 10^9 $ .
In order for the system to work properly, there are some constraints: for every $ i \in [1, n] $ , $ i $ -th junction has a number $ s_i $ associated with it meaning that the difference between incoming and outcoming flow for $ i $ -th junction must be exactly $ s_i $ (if $ s_i $ is not negative, then $ i $ -th junction must receive $ s_i $ units of water per second; if it is negative, then $ i $ -th junction must transfer $ |s_i| $ units of water per second to other junctions).
Can you choose the integers $ f_1 $ , $ f_2 $ , ..., $ f_m $ in such a way that all requirements on incoming and outcoming flows are satisfied?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of junctions.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n $ ( $ -10^4 \le s_i \le 10^4 $ ) — constraints for the junctions.
The third line contains an integer $ m $ ( $ 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of pipes.
$ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \le x_i, y_i \le n $ , $ x_i \ne y_i $ ) — the description of $ i $ -th pipe. It is guaranteed that each unordered pair $ (x, y) $ will appear no more than once in the input (it means that there won't be any pairs $ (x, y) $ or $ (y, x) $ after the first occurrence of $ (x, y) $ ). It is guaranteed that for each pair of junctions there exists a path along the pipes connecting them.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If you can choose such integer numbers $ f_1, f_2, \dots, f_m $ in such a way that all requirements on incoming and outcoming flows are satisfied, then output "Possible" in the first line. Then output $ m $ lines, $ i $ -th line should contain $ f_i $ — the chosen setting numbers for the pipes. Pipes are numbered in order they appear in the input.
Otherwise output "Impossible" in the only line.</div>
