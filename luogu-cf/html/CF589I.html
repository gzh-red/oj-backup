<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 管理员注：本题因未知原因已被 Codeforces 删除，不能提交。
题目描述：
今天，贝兰拿着彩票的奖品——一大笔钱！有K人参加彩票。它们中的每一个人将接收从1到k的唯一整数。
组织者买了n个球来组织这个彩票，每个球都涂了一些颜色，颜色从1到k。颜色C的球对应于同一数字的参与者。组织者将随机选择一个球-获胜者将是被选择的球的颜色对应的参赛者！
彩票开奖前五个小时，组织者意识到，为了让彩票公平，k种颜色的球必须是同样数量的。这将确保所有参与者的获胜机会相等。
你必须找到最少的需要重新油漆的球，使彩票公平。一个球可以重新粉刷成任何K颜色。
输入格式：
输入的第一行包含两个整数n和k(1<=k<=n<=100)——分别表示球的数量和参与者的数量。保证n可被K均匀地整除。
输入的第二行包含n个正整数Ci（1 <＝Ci<＝k）
其中Ci意思是第i个球的原始颜色。
输出格式：
单行输出一个整数，表示最小数量需要重新油漆的球，使每种颜色的球数相等。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today Berland holds a lottery with a prize — a huge sum of money! There are $ k $ persons, who attend the lottery. Each of them will receive a unique integer from 1 to $ k $ .
The organizers bought $ n $ balls to organize the lottery, each of them is painted some color, the colors are numbered from 1 to $ k $ . A ball of color $ c $ corresponds to the participant with the same number. The organizers will randomly choose one ball — and the winner will be the person whose color will be chosen!
Five hours before the start of the lottery the organizers realized that for the lottery to be fair there must be an equal number of balls of each of $ k $ colors. This will ensure that the chances of winning are equal for all the participants.
You have to find the minimum number of balls that you need to repaint to make the lottery fair. A ball can be repainted to any of the $ k $ colors.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=k<=n<=100) $ — the number of balls and the number of participants. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is evenly divisible by $ k $ .
The second line of the input contains space-separated sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ c_{i} $ $ (1<=c_{i}<=k) $ , where $ c_{i} $ means the original color of the $ i $ -th ball.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line of the output print a single integer — the minimum number of balls to repaint to make number of balls of each color equal.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 2
2 1 2 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>8 4
1 2 1 1 1 4 1 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the organizers need to repaint any ball of color 2 to the color 1.
In the second example the organizers need to repaint one ball of color 1 to the color 2 and two balls of the color 1 to the color 3.</div>
