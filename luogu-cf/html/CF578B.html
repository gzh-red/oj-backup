<h1>&quot;Or&quot; Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在有n个数$a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n$ 。你最多可以进行k次操作，每次操作你可以将其中一个数乘以$x$ 。找出使得$a_1|a_2|...|a_n$ 最大的方法，”|“代表位或。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ numbers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . You can perform at most $ k $ operations. For each operation you can multiply one of the numbers by $ x $ . We want to make ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF578B/4957ea745191dedda7c88dd7a9c0749def3ef4fd.png) as large as possible, where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF578B/228ea8924d84782194ed9458038dbd5525d21a6e.png) denotes the bitwise OR.
Find the maximum possible value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF578B/4957ea745191dedda7c88dd7a9c0749def3ef4fd.png) after performing at most $ k $ operations optimally.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ x $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ , $ 1<=k<=10 $ , $ 2<=x<=8 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the maximum value of a bitwise OR of sequence elements after performing operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 1 2
1 1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 2 3
1 2 4 8
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>79
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, any possible choice of doing one operation will result the same three numbers $ 1 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ so the result is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF578B/aa4bd67912899e33d42fc5cdc56c32c5fb40c4e1.png).
For the second sample if we multiply $ 8 $ by $ 3 $ two times we'll get $ 72 $ . In this case the numbers will become $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ , $ 72 $ so the OR value will be $ 79 $ and is the largest possible result.</div>
