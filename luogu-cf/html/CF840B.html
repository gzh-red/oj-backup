<h1>Leha and another game about graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>简单题意：给定你一些边，可能有重边。对于每个点给定一个 $d_i$，如果为 $1$ 表示这个点的度数为奇数，为 $0$ 表示这个点的度数为偶数，为 $-1$ 表示这个点的度数没有限制。你需要选出一些边（不一定联通），使得这些边构成的图符合要求。
对于输入保证图一定联通

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leha plays a computer game, where is on each level is given a connected graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. Graph can contain multiple edges, but can not contain self loops. Each vertex has an integer $ d_{i} $ , which can be equal to $ 0 $ , $ 1 $ or $ -1 $ . To pass the level, he needs to find a «good» subset of edges of the graph or say, that it doesn't exist. Subset is called «good», if by by leaving only edges from this subset in the original graph, we obtain the following: for every vertex i, $ d_{i} $ = - 1 or it's degree modulo 2 is equal to $ d_{i} $ . Leha wants to pass the game as soon as possible and ask you to help him. In case of multiple correct answers, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ , $ n-1<=m<=3·10^{5} $ ) — number of vertices and edges.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ d_{1},d_{2},...,d_{n} $ ( $ -1<=d_{i}<=1 $ ) — numbers on the vertices.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ ) — edges. It's guaranteed, that graph in the input is connected.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ -1 $ in a single line, if solution doesn't exist. Otherwise in the first line $ k $ — number of edges in a subset. In the next $ k $ lines indexes of edges. Edges are numerated in order as they are given in the input, starting from $ 1 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample we have single vertex without edges. It's degree is 0 and we can not get 1.</div>
