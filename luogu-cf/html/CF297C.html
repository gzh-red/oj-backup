<h1>Splitting the Uniqueness</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意：给定n个互不相同的非负整数数列s。构造两个非负整数数列a与b。使得ai+bi=si。满足a与b都近似不同。 一个数列S被称为近似不同当且仅当可以移去不超过S/3上取整后互不相同。（例如4就是移去2个数） n<=100000,0<=si<=10^9。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polar bears like unique arrays — that is, arrays without repeated elements.
You have got a unique array $ s $ with length $ n $ containing non-negative integers. Since you are good friends with Alice and Bob, you decide to split the array in two. Precisely, you need to construct two arrays $ a $ and $ b $ that are also of length $ n $ , with the following conditions for all $ i $ $ (1<=i<=n) $ :
- $ a_{i},b_{i} $ are non-negative integers;
- $ s_{i}=a_{i}+b_{i} $ .
Ideally, $ a $ and $ b $ should also be unique arrays. However, life in the Arctic is hard and this is not always possible. Fortunately, Alice and Bob are still happy if their arrays are almost unique. We define an array of length $ n $ to be almost unique, if and only if it can be turned into a unique array by removing no more than ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297C/c5d8ea1c11ba761a920db324eef984cdbae28ef7.png) entries.
For example, the array $ [1,2,1,3,2] $ is almost unique because after removing the first two entries, it becomes $ [1,3,2] $ . The array $ [1,2,1,3,1,2] $ is not almost unique because we need to remove at least $ 3 $ entries to turn it into a unique array.
So, your task is to split the given unique array $ s $ into two almost unique arrays $ a $ and $ b $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ .
The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ s_{1},s_{2},...\ s_{n} $ $ (0<=s_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is possible to make Alice and Bob happy (if you can split the given array), print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line, print the array $ a $ . In the third line, print the array $ b $ . There may be more than one solution. Any of them will be accepted.
If it is impossible to split $ s $ into almost unique arrays $ a $ and $ b $ , print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the sample, we can remove the first two entries from $ a $ and the second entry from $ b $ to make them both unique.</div>
