<h1>Distance in Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目大意
输入点数为$N$一棵树
求树上长度恰好为$K$的路径个数
## 输入格式
第一行两个数字$N,K$,如题意
接下来的$N-1$行中,每行两个整数$u,v$表示一条树边$(u,v)$
## 输出格式
一个整数$ans$,如题意
在$Codeforces$上提交时记得用$\%I64d$哦.QwQ
## 数据范围
$1 \leq n \leq 50000$
$1 \leq k \leq 500$
感谢@Zhang_RQ 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A tree is a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles.
The distance between two vertices of a tree is the length (in edges) of the shortest path between these vertices.
You are given a tree with $ n $ vertices and a positive number $ k $ . Find the number of distinct pairs of the vertices which have a distance of exactly $ k $ between them. Note that pairs ( $ v $ , $ u $ ) and ( $ u $ , $ v $ ) are considered to be the same pair.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=50000 $ , $ 1<=k<=500 $ ) — the number of vertices and the required distance between the vertices.
Next $ n-1 $ lines describe the edges as " $ a_{i} $ $ b_{i} $ " (without the quotes) ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ are the vertices connected by the $ i $ -th edge. All given edges are different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of distinct pairs of the tree's vertices which have a distance of exactly $ k $ between them.
Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
