<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Alice和Bob在玩一个游戏，现在有n（n是偶数）个石堆，每堆石头有Ai个，现在由Alice先，两人轮流从任意n/2个石堆中移出至少一个石头，当谁移完之后堆数<n/2，那么TA就赢了。 现在要你求出谁会胜利，输出TA的名字（见样例） 注意：两人都很聪明，用最佳策略</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice and Bob are playing a game with $ n $ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is an even number. The $ i $ -th pile has $ a_i $ stones.
Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.
On a player's turn, they must choose exactly $ \frac{n}{2} $ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $ \frac{n}{2} $ nonempty piles).
Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 50 $ ) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is an even number.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 50 $ ) — the number of stones in the piles.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single string "Alice" if Alice wins; otherwise, print "Bob" (without double quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ( $ \frac{2}{2}=1 $ ). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first.
In the second example, Alice can remove $ 2 $ stones from the first pile and $ 3 $ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.</div>
