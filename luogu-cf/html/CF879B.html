<h1>Table Tennis</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**CF879B Table Tennis **
**题目:**
$n$ 个人打乒乓球,先让前两个人打比赛,赢的人依次和下一个人打比赛,输的人到队尾排队.两个人的比赛由这两个人的能力值确定,能力值大的人获胜,所有人的能力值都不同.连续获胜$k$ 场的人将成为胜利者.
**输入:**
第一行两个整数 $n$ , $k$ $(2<=n<=500, 2<=k<=10^{12})$ , 分别表示人数和需要连续获胜的次数.
第二行$n$ 个整数 $a_1, a_2,..., a_n (1<=a_i<=n)$ 分别表示每个人的能力值.
**输出:** 仅一个整数,胜利者的能力值.

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> $ n $ people are standing in a line to play table tennis. At first, the first two players in the line play a game. Then the loser goes to the end of the line, and the winner plays with the next person from the line, and so on. They play until someone wins $ k $ games in a row. This player becomes the winner.
For each of the participants, you know the power to play table tennis, and for all players these values are different. In a game the player with greater power always wins. Determine who will be the winner.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers: $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=500 $ , $ 2<=k<=10^{12} $ ) — the number of people and the number of wins.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) — powers of the player. It's guaranteed that this line contains a valid permutation, i.e. all $ a_{i} $ are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — power of the winner.</div>
