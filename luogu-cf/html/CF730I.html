<h1>Olympiad in Programming and Sports</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述：
伯兰州立大学有N个学生。每个学生都有两种技能，每种技能分别是a，b，其中a表示编程能力，b表示运动能力。 又一届奥林匹亚竞赛和体育运动竞赛即将开始，为此，伯兰州立大学应该分出两个团队：一个参加编程比赛，一个参加体育比赛。在编程团队中有p人，在体育团队中有s人。同一个学生不能同时参加两项比赛。比赛的组织者们认为整个团队的实力为两个团队的实力的总和：编程实力与运动实力。团队的力量是其成员在相应领域的技能总和，所以编程团队的实力是所有ai值的总和，而运动团队的实力是所有bi值的总和。 请你帮助伯兰州立大学组成两支队伍，以最大限度地提高大学在奥运会上的总实力。
输入输出格式
输入：共三行。
第一行包含三个正整数n，p，s。 2<=n<=3000，并且有p+s<=n。
第二行包含n个整数a1，a2……an，有1<=ai<=3000，ai表示第i个同学参加编程的实力。
第三行包含n个整数b1，b2……bn，有1<=bi<=3000,bi表示第i个同学参加运动的实力。
输出：
第一行输出整个团队最大的实力。
正如输入的一样，下面两行输出的数字是不同的，并且按照任意顺序输出两个团队学生编号。
如果有多组答案，请把他们都输出。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ students at Berland State University. Every student has two skills, each measured as a number: $ a_{i} $ — the programming skill and $ b_{i} $ — the sports skill.
It is announced that an Olympiad in programming and sports will be held soon. That's why Berland State University should choose two teams: one to take part in the programming track and one to take part in the sports track.
There should be exactly $ p $ students in the programming team and exactly $ s $ students in the sports team. A student can't be a member of both teams.
The university management considers that the strength of the university on the Olympiad is equal to the sum of two values: the programming team strength and the sports team strength. The strength of a team is the sum of skills of its members in the corresponding area, so the strength of the programming team is the sum of all $ a_{i} $ and the strength of the sports team is the sum of all $ b_{i} $ over corresponding team members.
Help Berland State University to compose two teams to maximize the total strength of the university on the Olympiad.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three positive integer numbers $ n $ , $ p $ and $ s $ ( $ 2<=n<=3000 $ , $ p+s<=n $ ) — the number of students, the size of the programming team and the size of the sports team.
The second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=3000 $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the programming skill of the $ i $ -th student.
The third line contains $ n $ positive integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=3000 $ ), where $ b_{i} $ is the sports skill of the $ i $ -th student.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, print the the maximum strength of the university on the Olympiad. In the second line, print $ p $ numbers — the members of the programming team. In the third line, print $ s $ numbers — the members of the sports team.
The students are numbered from 1 to $ n $ as they are given in the input. All numbers printed in the second and in the third lines should be distinct and can be printed in arbitrary order.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</div>
