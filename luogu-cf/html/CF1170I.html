<h1>Good Subsets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**本题仅允许使用`kotlin`提交**
`NaCly_Fish`画了一个数轴，然后给了你$n$条线段，第$i$条线段的覆盖范围是$[l_i,r_i]$。
她想知道这$n$条线段有多少子集的覆盖范围和这$n$条线段的覆盖范围相同。
由于答案可能很大，所以要模上$998244353$。
我们认为一个线段的集合的覆盖范围是这些线段的并。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ segments on the $ Ox $ axis. The $ i $ -th segment is given as a pair $ l_i, r_i $ , where $ l_i $ is the position of the left end of the $ i $ -th segment and $ r_i $ is the position of the right end of the $ i $ -th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap, or even coincide. A segment is a set of numbers (including floating-point numbers) lying between the segment ends or coinciding with them. Formally, the segment $ [l, r]=\{x~|~x \in \Bbb{R},~l \le x \le r\} $ .
Let the union of segments be the set of all axis points covered by the set of segments. Let's call a subset of the given segments good if its union equals the union of all $ n $ segments.
Your task is to calculate the number of good subsets of the given $ n $ segments. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of segments.
The next $ n $ lines contain segments. The $ i $ -th segment is given as a pair $ l_i, r_i $ ( $ 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ l_i $ is the left border of the segment and $ r_i $ is the right border of the segment. Segments may intersect, overlap, or even coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of good subsets of the given set of segments. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>
