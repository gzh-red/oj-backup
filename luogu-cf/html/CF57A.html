<h1>Square Earth?</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
Meg小兔兔想当一次活雷锋——他要为大家判断地球之上两点之间的最短距离。但是Meg……他比较的懒，所以说他将地球想象成了一个平面的原型。等等……不对，他是把地球想象成了一个边长为$ n $的二维正方形。所以说，Meg的任务已经变得非常简单了：找出正方形平面边上两点之间的最短距离。那么，在这道题中我们会定义正方形四个角的坐标分别为$ (0, 0), (n, 0), (0, n), (n, n) $。
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
一行，包含五个整数：$n, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ $(1 \leq n \leq 1000, 0 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq n)$，分别代表正方形的边长，和边上两点的坐标。
## 输出格式：
一个数，两点之间的最短路线。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Meg the Rabbit decided to do something nice, specifically — to determine the shortest distance between two points on the surface of our planet. But Meg... what can you say, she wants everything simple. So, she already regards our planet as a two-dimensional circle. No, wait, it's even worse — as a square of side $ n $ . Thus, the task has been reduced to finding the shortest path between two dots on a square (the path should go through the square sides). To simplify the task let us consider the vertices of the square to lie at points whose coordinates are: $ (0,0) $ , $ (n,0) $ , $ (0,n) $ and $ (n,n) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains 5 space-separated integers: $ n,x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2} $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000,0<=x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}<=n $ ) which correspondingly represent a side of the square, the coordinates of the first point and the coordinates of the second point. It is guaranteed that the points lie on the sides of the square.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You must print on a single line the shortest distance between the points.</div>
