<h1>Minimization</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定数组$A$ 和值$k$ ，你可以重排$A$ 中的元素，使得$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} |A_i-A_{i+k}|$ 最小。输出最小值。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got array $ A $ , consisting of $ n $ integers and a positive integer $ k $ . Array $ A $ is indexed by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
You need to permute the array elements so that value
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF571B/74275c71e404f8e7fe1cae2f08e7a067764084b1.png) became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n,k $ ( $ 2<=n<=3·10^{5} $ , $ 1<=k<=min(5000,n-1) $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ A[1],A[2],...,A[n] $ ( $ -10^{9}<=A[i]<=10^{9} $ ), separate by spaces — elements of the array $ A $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum possible value of the sum described in the statement.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test one of the optimal permutations is $ 1 4 2 $ .
In the second test the initial order is optimal.
In the third test one of the optimal permutations is $ 2 3 4 4 3 5 $ .</div>
