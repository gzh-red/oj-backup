<h1>Fractal</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目背景**
自从著名的柏林抽象主义者卡莱维奇听说分形后，他就把分形作为自己油画的主题。每天早上，他拿着一张绘图纸，开始制作他未来画布的模型。
## 题目描述
给出染色正方形的边长n，并给出染色的方法，执行k次操作（即正方形图纸的边长为n^k），每次操作将图放大，按给出的方法将图涂黑，下一步再将图中的每块白色正方形部分按给出的方法染黑
## 输入输出格式
**输入格式：**
第一行包括两个数字n和k(2<=n<=3,1<=k<=5)，
接下来第二行到第n+1行输入染色的方法
**输出格式：**
输出一个边长为n^k的正方形，即最后染色完的画，白色格输出' . ',黑色格输出' * '</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ever since Kalevitch, a famous Berland abstractionist, heard of fractals, he made them the main topic of his canvases. Every morning the artist takes a piece of graph paper and starts with making a model of his future canvas. He takes a square as big as $ n×n $ squares and paints some of them black. Then he takes a clean square piece of paper and paints the fractal using the following algorithm:
Step 1. The paper is divided into $ n^{2} $ identical squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.
Step 2. Every square that remains white is divided into $ n^{2} $ smaller squares and some of them are painted black according to the model.
Every following step repeats step 2.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF36B/e8422806af6330609da67545ef59f385e8f81169.png)Unfortunately, this tiresome work demands too much time from the painting genius. Kalevitch has been dreaming of making the process automatic to move to making 3D or even 4D fractals.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=3 $ , $ 1<=k<=5 $ ), where $ k $ is the amount of steps of the algorithm. Each of the following $ n $ lines contains $ n $ symbols that determine the model. Symbol «.» stands for a white square, whereas «\*» stands for a black one. It is guaranteed that the model has at least one white square.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a matrix $ n^{k}×n^{k} $ which is what a picture should look like after $ k $ steps of the algorithm.</div>
