<h1>Cosmic Tables</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Free Meteor Association (FMA) has got a problem: as meteors are moving, the Universal Cosmic Descriptive Humorous Program (UCDHP) needs to add a special module that would analyze this movement.
UCDHP stores some secret information about meteors as an $ n×m $ table with integers in its cells. The order of meteors in the Universe is changing. That's why the main UCDHP module receives the following queries:
- The query to swap two table rows;
- The query to swap two table columns;
- The query to obtain a secret number in a particular table cell.
As the main UCDHP module is critical, writing the functional of working with the table has been commissioned to you.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=1000 $ , $ 1<=k<=500000 $ ) — the number of table columns and rows and the number of queries, correspondingly.
Next $ n $ lines contain $ m $ space-separated numbers each — the initial state of the table. Each number $ p $ in the table is an integer and satisfies the inequality $ 0<=p<=10^{6} $ .
Next $ k $ lines contain queries in the format " $ s_{i} $ $ x_{i} $ $ y_{i} $ ", where $ s_{i} $ is one of the characters "с", "r" or "g", and $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ are two integers.
- If $ s_{i} $ = "c", then the current query is the query to swap columns with indexes $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=m,x≠y $ );
- If $ s_{i} $ = "r", then the current query is the query to swap rows with indexes $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n,x≠y $ );
- If $ s_{i} $ = "g", then the current query is the query to obtain the number that located in the $ x_{i} $ -th row and in the $ y_{i} $ -th column ( $ 1<=x<=n,1<=y<=m $ ).
The table rows are considered to be indexed from top to bottom from 1 to $ n $ , and the table columns — from left to right from 1 to $ m $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query to obtain a number ( $ s_{i} $ = "g") print the required number. Print the answers to the queries in the order of the queries in the input.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Let's see how the table changes in the second test case.
After the first operation is fulfilled, the table looks like that:
2 1 4
1 3 5
After the second operation is fulfilled, the table looks like that:
1 3 5
2 1 4
So the answer to the third query (the number located in the first row and in the third column) will be 5.</div>
