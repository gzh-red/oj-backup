<h1>The Beatles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n*k个城市围成一个环
在第1,1+k,1+2k,1+(n-1)k个城市处有金拱门
小A非常喜欢吃金拱门的黄金脆皮鸡和吮指原味鸡
小A喜欢诗和远方，所以他要从S城市开始环球旅行
但是他KFC吃多了，于是忘了从哪里出发
他每次会走L条边，但是，他也忘了L是多少
他只记得出发位置距离最近金拱门的边数
当他重新走回S城旅行就停止了
他想问问你
他最多环球旅行了多少圈
他最少环球旅行了多少圈
（l<=n*k）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently a Golden Circle of Beetlovers was found in Byteland. It is a circle route going through $ n \cdot k $ cities. The cities are numerated from $ 1 $ to $ n \cdot k $ , the distance between the neighboring cities is exactly $ 1 $ km.
Sergey does not like beetles, he loves burgers. Fortunately for him, there are $ n $ fast food restaurants on the circle, they are located in the $ 1 $ -st, the $ (k + 1) $ -st, the $ (2k + 1) $ -st, and so on, the $ ((n-1)k + 1) $ -st cities, i.e. the distance between the neighboring cities with fast food restaurants is $ k $ km.
Sergey began his journey at some city $ s $ and traveled along the circle, making stops at cities each $ l $ km ( $ l > 0 $ ), until he stopped in $ s $ once again. Sergey then forgot numbers $ s $ and $ l $ , but he remembers that the distance from the city $ s $ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $ a $ km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first $ l $ km from $ s $ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $ b $ km. Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions.
Now Sergey is interested in two integers. The first integer $ x $ is the minimum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to $ s $ . The second integer $ y $ is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n, k \le 100\,000 $ ) — the number of fast food restaurants on the circle and the distance between the neighboring restaurants, respectively.
The second line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 0 \le a, b \le \frac{k}{2} $ ) — the distances to the nearest fast food restaurants from the initial city and from the city Sergey made the first stop at, respectively.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the restaurants are located in the cities $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ , the initial city $ s $ could be $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ , or $ 6 $ . The next city Sergey stopped at could also be at cities $ 2, 3, 5, 6 $ . Let's loop through all possible combinations of these cities. If both $ s $ and the city of the first stop are at the city $ 2 $ (for example, $ l = 6 $ ), then Sergey is at $ s $ after the first stop already, so $ x = 1 $ . In other pairs Sergey needs $ 1, 2, 3 $ , or $ 6 $ stops to return to $ s $ , so $ y = 6 $ .
In the second example Sergey was at cities with fast food restaurant both initially and after the first stop, so $ l $ is $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ , or $ 6 $ . Thus $ x = 1 $ , $ y = 3 $ .
In the third example there is only one restaurant, so the possible locations of $ s $ and the first stop are: $ (6, 8) $ and $ (6, 4) $ . For the first option $ l = 2 $ , for the second $ l = 8 $ . In both cases Sergey needs $ x=y=5 $ stops to go to $ s $ .</div>
