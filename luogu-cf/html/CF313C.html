<h1>Ilya and Matrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ilya is a very good-natured lion. He likes maths. Of all mathematical objects, his favourite one is matrices. Now he's faced a complicated matrix problem he needs to solve.
He's got a square $ 2^{n}×2^{n} $ -sized matrix and $ 4^{n} $ integers. You need to arrange all these numbers in the matrix (put each number in a single individual cell) so that the beauty of the resulting matrix with numbers is maximum.
The beauty of a $ 2^{n}×2^{n} $ -sized matrix is an integer, obtained by the following algorithm:
1. Find the maximum element in the matrix. Let's denote it as $ m $ .
2. If $ n=0 $ , then the beauty of the matrix equals $ m $ . Otherwise, a matrix can be split into 4 non-intersecting $ 2^{n-1}×2^{n-1} $ -sized submatrices, then the beauty of the matrix equals the sum of number $ m $ and other four beauties of the described submatrices.
As you can see, the algorithm is recursive.
Help Ilya, solve the problem and print the resulting maximum beauty of the matrix.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ 4^{n} $ $ (1<=4^{n}<=2·10^{6}) $ . The next line contains $ 4^{n} $ integers $ a_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{9}) $ — the numbers you need to arrange in the $ 2^{n}×2^{n} $ -sized matrix.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line print the maximum value of the beauty of the described matrix.
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
13

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4
1 2 3 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>14
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the second sample. You need to arrange the numbers in the matrix as follows:
`<br></br>1 2<br></br>3 4<br></br>`Then the beauty of the matrix will equal: 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 14.</div>
