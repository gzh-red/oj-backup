<h1>Fedya and Maths</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Fedya 在健身房里学习。她的数学作业是计算下面一个东西。
对于每个给定的n,计算(1^n+2^n+3^n+4^n+5^n)mod 5.n可能会很大，但结果肯定在整形范围内。
输入：
仅一个数，表示n。
输出：
输出上述结果。
样例说明：
1^4+2^4+3^4+4^4+5^4 = 979 979 mod 5 = 4
感谢 @一个懵了的人 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fedya studies in a gymnasium. Fedya's maths hometask is to calculate the following expression:
$ (1^{n}+2^{n}+3^{n}+4^{n}) mod 5 $ for given value of $ n $ . Fedya managed to complete the task. Can you? Note that given number $ n $ can be extremely large (e.g. it can exceed any integer type of your programming language).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{105} $ ). The number doesn't contain any leading zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the value of the expression without leading zeros.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
