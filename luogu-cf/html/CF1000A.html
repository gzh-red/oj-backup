<h1>Codehorses T-shirts</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意：**
$n$个字符串和$n$个模板串，在$1s$的时间内你可以选择一个字符串（不是模板串）修改任意多的字符，但是不能删除或增加字符，问至少需要多少s使得字符串变为模板串，注意不考虑串的顺序，即最后每个字符串出现次数=这个串在模板串中的出现次数
**输入格式：**
第一行一个整数，$n$，$n<=100$
以下$n$行每行一个字符串
再$n$行每行一个模板串
**输出格式：**
一个整数，即最少时间
感谢@守望 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Codehorses has just hosted the second Codehorses Cup. This year, the same as the previous one, organizers are giving T-shirts for the winners.
The valid sizes of T-shirts are either "M" or from $ 0 $ to $ 3 $ "X" followed by "S" or "L". For example, sizes "M", "XXS", "L", "XXXL" are valid and "XM", "Z", "XXXXL" are not.
There are $ n $ winners to the cup for both the previous year and the current year. Ksenia has a list with the T-shirt sizes printed for the last year cup and is yet to send the new list to the printing office.
Organizers want to distribute the prizes as soon as possible, so now Ksenia is required not to write the whole list from the scratch but just make some changes to the list of the previous year. In one second she can choose arbitrary position in any word and replace its character with some uppercase Latin letter. Ksenia can't remove or add letters in any of the words.
What is the minimal number of seconds Ksenia is required to spend to change the last year list to the current one?
The lists are unordered. That means, two lists are considered equal if and only if the number of occurrences of any string is the same in both lists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of T-shirts.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains $ a_i $ — the size of the $ i $ -th T-shirt of the list for the previous year.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains $ b_i $ — the size of the $ i $ -th T-shirt of the list for the current year.
It is guaranteed that all the sizes in the input are valid. It is also guaranteed that Ksenia can produce list $ b $ from the list $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimal number of seconds Ksenia is required to spend to change the last year list to the current one. If the lists are already equal, print 0.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Ksenia can replace "M" with "S" and "S" in one of the occurrences of "XS" with "L".
In the second example Ksenia should replace "L" in "XXXL" with "S".
In the third example lists are equal.</div>
