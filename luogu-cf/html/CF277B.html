<h1>Set of Points</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Convexity of a set of points on the plane is the size of the largest subset of points that form a convex polygon. Your task is to build a set of $ n $ points with the convexity of exactly $ m $ . Your set of points should not contain three points that lie on a straight line.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 3<=m<=100,m<=n<=2m $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no solution, print "-1". Otherwise, print $ n $ pairs of integers — the coordinates of points of any set with the convexity of $ m $ . The coordinates shouldn't exceed $ 10^{8} $ in their absolute value.</div>
