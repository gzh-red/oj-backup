<h1>Two Buttons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Vasya找到了一个奇怪的设备。
在设备的前面板上有一个红色按钮，一个蓝色按钮和一个显示屏用于一个正整数的显示
按动红色按钮会把显示屏上的正整数乘以2
按动蓝色按钮会把显示屏上的正整数减去1
现在告诉你显示屏的初始示数n
要变成m，问最少按多少次
输入一排两个数 n m</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has found a strange device. On the front panel of a device there are: a red button, a blue button and a display showing some positive integer. After clicking the red button, device multiplies the displayed number by two. After clicking the blue button, device subtracts one from the number on the display. If at some point the number stops being positive, the device breaks down. The display can show arbitrarily large numbers. Initially, the display shows number $ n $ .
Bob wants to get number $ m $ on the display. What minimum number of clicks he has to make in order to achieve this result?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and the only line of the input contains two distinct integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{4} $ ), separated by a space .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the minimum number of times one needs to push the button required to get the number $ m $ out of number $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>10 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you need to push the blue button once, and then push the red button once.
In the second example, doubling the number is unnecessary, so we need to push the blue button nine times.</div>
