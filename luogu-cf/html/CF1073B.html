<h1>Vasya and Books</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># codeforces 1073B div2 2018.10.25
## 题目大意:
给定 $n$ 本书,序号分别为$1$到$n$，现在执行$n$个操作，
第$i$个操作需要从栈内取出编号为$b_i$的书，如果该书已经取出，则输出```0```否则将该书从栈内取出，同时取出在栈内比$b_i$靠上的书，并且输出一共取出了几本书</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has got $ n $ books, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , arranged in a stack. The topmost book has number $ a_1 $ , the next one — $ a_2 $ , and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number $ a_n $ . All numbers are distinct.
Vasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in $ n $ steps. During $ i $ -th step he wants to move the book number $ b_i $ into his backpack. If the book with number $ b_i $ is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book $ b_i $ , and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order $ [1, 2, 3] $ (book $ 1 $ is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order $ [2, 1, 3] $ , then during the first step he will move two books ( $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ ), during the second step he will do nothing (since book $ 1 $ is already in the backpack), and during the third step — one book (the book number $ 3 $ ). Note that $ b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n $ are distinct.
Help Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) $ — the number of books in the stack.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n~(1 \le a_i \le n) $ denoting the stack of books.
The third line contains $ n $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n~(1 \le b_i \le n) $ denoting the steps Vasya is going to perform.
All numbers $ a_1 \dots a_n $ are distinct, the same goes for $ b_1 \dots b_n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers. The $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the number of books Vasya moves to his backpack during the $ i $ -th step.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first example is described in the statement.
In the second example, during the first step Vasya will move the books $ [3, 1, 4] $ . After that only books $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ remain in the stack ( $ 2 $ is above $ 5 $ ). During the second step Vasya will take the books $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ . After that the stack becomes empty, so during next steps Vasya won't move any books.</div>
