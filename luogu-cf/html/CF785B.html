<h1>Anton and Classes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题目描述】
Anton很喜欢下棋，同时又很喜欢编程。难怪，他会想去参加棋艺班和编程班！
一共有n个棋艺班，m个编程班。第i个棋艺班的时间用$(l_{1,i},r_{1,i})$表示，第i个编程班的时间用$(l_{2,i},r_{2,i})$表示。
Anton需要在全部的棋艺班和编程班中间恰好各选一个。他想要在两个班之间有休息的时间，所以对于所有可能的选择，他希望两个时间段的距离（即他的休息时间）最大。
两个时间段$(l_1,r_1)$和$(l_2,r_2)$的距离是这样定义的：对于$l_1\le i\le r_1$，$l_2\le j\le r_2$，距离就是$|i-j|$的最小值。如果两个时间段相交，那么他们的距离当然就是$0$。
Anton很想知道，他的休息时间最大是多少。帮帮他解决这个问题吧！
【输入格式】
第一行一个整数n。
第2~n+1行，每行两个数$l_{1,i}$和$r_{1,i}$。
第n+2行一个整数m。
接下来mmm行，每行两个数$l_{2,i}$和$r_{2,i}$。
保证$1<=n,m<=200000$。对于输入中的所有$x$，保证$1<=x<=10^9$。
【输出格式】
一个整数，表示Anton的最大休息时间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Anton likes to play chess. Also he likes to do programming. No wonder that he decided to attend chess classes and programming classes.
Anton has $ n $ variants when he will attend chess classes, $ i $ -th variant is given by a period of time $ (l_{1,i},r_{1,i}) $ . Also he has $ m $ variants when he will attend programming classes, $ i $ -th variant is given by a period of time $ (l_{2,i},r_{2,i}) $ .
Anton needs to choose exactly one of $ n $ possible periods of time when he will attend chess classes and exactly one of $ m $ possible periods of time when he will attend programming classes. He wants to have a rest between classes, so from all the possible pairs of the periods he wants to choose the one where the distance between the periods is maximal.
The distance between periods $ (l_{1},r_{1}) $ and $ (l_{2},r_{2}) $ is the minimal possible distance between a point in the first period and a point in the second period, that is the minimal possible $ |i-j| $ , where $ l_{1}<=i<=r_{1} $ and $ l_{2}<=j<=r_{2} $ . In particular, when the periods intersect, the distance between them is $ 0 $ .
Anton wants to know how much time his rest between the classes will last in the best case. Help Anton and find this number!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=200000) $ — the number of time periods when Anton can attend chess classes.
Each of the following $ n $ lines of the input contains two integers $ l_{1,i} $ and $ r_{1,i} $ $ (1<=l_{1,i}<=r_{1,i}<=10^{9}) $ — the $ i $ -th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend chess classes.
The following line of the input contains a single integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=200000) $ — the number of time periods when Anton can attend programming classes.
Each of the following $ m $ lines of the input contains two integers $ l_{2,i} $ and $ r_{2,i} $ $ (1<=l_{2,i}<=r_{2,i}<=10^{9}) $ — the $ i $ -th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend programming classes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer — the maximal possible distance between time periods.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample Anton can attend chess classes in the period $ (2,3) $ and attend programming classes in the period $ (6,8) $ . It's not hard to see that in this case the distance between the periods will be equal to $ 3 $ .
In the second sample if he chooses any pair of periods, they will intersect. So the answer is $ 0 $ .</div>
