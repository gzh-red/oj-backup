<h1>Hongcow Masters the Cyclic Shift</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Hongcow's teacher heard that Hongcow had learned about the cyclic shift, and decided to set the following problem for him.
You are given a list of $ n $ strings $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ contained in the list $ A $ .
A list $ X $ of strings is called stable if the following condition holds.
First, a message is defined as a concatenation of some elements of the list $ X $ . You can use an arbitrary element as many times as you want, and you may concatenate these elements in any arbitrary order. Let $ S_{X} $ denote the set of of all messages you can construct from the list. Of course, this set has infinite size if your list is nonempty.
Call a single message good if the following conditions hold:
- Suppose the message is the concatenation of $ k $ strings $ w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{k} $ , where each $ w_{i} $ is an element of $ X $ .
- Consider the $ |w_{1}|+|w_{2}|+...+|w_{k}| $ cyclic shifts of the string. Let $ m $ be the number of these cyclic shifts of the string that are elements of $ S_{X} $ .
- A message is good if and only if $ m $ is exactly equal to $ k $ .
The list $ X $ is called stable if and only if every element of $ S_{X} $ is good.
Let $ f(L) $ be $ 1 $ if $ L $ is a stable list, and $ 0 $ otherwise.
Find the sum of $ f(L) $ where $ L $ is a nonempty contiguous sublist of $ A $ (there are ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF744E/e3b4fb96ad236b842d8223d40fcab7d30a68cb22.png) contiguous sublists in total).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will contain a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=30 $ ), denoting the number of strings in the list.
The next $ n $ lines will each contain a string $ s_{i} $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF744E/aa511b29228806a7ab9d89d220f5a75566cfa547.png)).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, the number of nonempty contiguous sublists that are stable.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample, there are $ 10 $ sublists to consider. Sublists \["a", "ab", "b"\], \["ab", "b", "bba"\], and \["a", "ab", "b", "bba"\] are not stable. The other seven sublists are stable.
For example, $ X $ = \["a", "ab", "b"\] is not stable, since the message "ab" + "ab" = "abab" has four cyclic shifts \["abab", "baba", "abab", "baba"\], which are all elements of $ S_{X} $ .</div>
