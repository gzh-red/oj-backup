<h1>Lost in Transliteration</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一些单词,每个单词中"oo"和"u","kh"和"h"分别可以互相替换.如果单词a可以通过这样的替换变成单词b,则称a和b相同.问这些单词中有多少种不同的单词.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.
For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as "u", and can be written as "oo". For this reason, two words "ulyana" and "oolyana" denote the same name.
The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both "h" and "kh" to write it. For example, the words "mihail" and "mikhail" denote the same name.
There are $ n $ users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?
Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements "u" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/77b2db707b29a82aec640f23cbd1fafe4293bbb0.png) "oo" and "h" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/77b2db707b29a82aec640f23cbd1fafe4293bbb0.png) "kh", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.
For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:
- "koouper" and "kuooper". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: "koouper" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) "kuuper" and "kuooper" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) "kuuper".
- "khun" and "kkkhoon". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: "khun" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) "khoon" and "kkkhoon" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) "kkhoon" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF883F/355fee5161a1808ee95ea5dc6d815d4071657131.png) "khoon".

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There are four groups of words in the first example. Words in each group denote same name:
1. "mihail", "mikhail"
2. "oolyana", "ulyana"
3. "kooooper", "koouper"
4. "hoon", "khun", "kkkhoon"
There are five groups of words in the second example. Words in each group denote same name:
1. "hariton", "kkkhariton", "khariton"
2. "hkariton"
3. "buoi", "boooi", "boui"
4. "bui"
5. "boi"
In the third example the words are equal, so they denote the same name.</div>
