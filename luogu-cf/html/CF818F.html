<h1>Level Generation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan is developing his own computer game. Now he tries to create some levels for his game. But firstly for each level he needs to draw a graph representing the structure of the level.
Ivan decided that there should be exactly $ n_{i} $ vertices in the graph representing level $ i $ , and the edges have to be bidirectional. When constructing the graph, Ivan is interested in special edges called bridges. An edge between two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ is called a bridge if this edge belongs to every path between $ u $ and $ v $ (and these vertices will belong to different connected components if we delete this edge). For each level Ivan wants to construct a graph where at least half of the edges are bridges. He also wants to maximize the number of edges in each constructed graph.
So the task Ivan gave you is: given $ q $ numbers $ n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{q} $ , for each $ i $ tell the maximum number of edges in a graph with $ n_{i} $ vertices, if at least half of the edges are bridges. Note that the graphs cannot contain multiple edges or self-loops.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input file contains a positive integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) — the number of graphs Ivan needs to construct.
Then $ q $ lines follow, $ i $ -th line contains one positive integer $ n_{i} $ ( $ 1<=n_{i}<=2·10^{9} $ ) — the number of vertices in $ i $ -th graph.
Note that in hacks you have to use $ q=1 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ q $ numbers, $ i $ -th of them must be equal to the maximum number of edges in $ i $ -th graph.</div>

<div>In the first example it is possible to construct these graphs:
1. $ 1-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ ;
2. $ 1-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ , $ 2-4 $ ;
3. $ 1-2 $ , $ 1-3 $ , $ 2-3 $ , $ 1-4 $ , $ 2-5 $ , $ 3-6 $ .</div>
