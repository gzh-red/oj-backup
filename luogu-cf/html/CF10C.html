<h1>Digital Root</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义函数s(x)，s(x)的值等于x各数位上的数值之和，定义函数d(x)，当s(x)<=9时d(x)=s(x)，否则d(x)=d(s(x))，举例来说，d(6543)=d(6+5+4+3)=d(18)=9
现在给定一上限N，求在[1.N]内任取A，B，C满足A*B!=C且d(C)=d(d(A)⋅d(B))的组数
N<=1000000

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Not long ago Billy came across such a problem, where there were given three natural numbers $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ from the range $ [1,N] $ , and it was asked to check whether the equation $ AB=C $ is correct. Recently Billy studied the concept of a digital root of a number. We should remind you that a digital root $ d(x) $ of the number $ x $ is the sum $ s(x) $ of all the digits of this number, if $ s(x)<=9 $ , otherwise it is $ d(s(x)) $ . For example, a digital root of the number 6543 is calculated as follows: $ d(6543)=d(6+5+4+3)=d(18)=9 $ . Billy has counted that the digital root of a product of numbers is equal to the digital root of the product of the factors' digital roots, i.e. $ d(xy)=d(d(x)d(y)) $ . And the following solution to the problem came to his mind: to calculate the digital roots and check if this condition is met. However, Billy has doubts that this condition is sufficient. That's why he asks you to find out the amount of test examples for the given problem such that the algorithm proposed by Billy makes mistakes.</div>
