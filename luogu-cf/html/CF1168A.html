<h1>Increasing by Modulo</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n,m,以及m个数a[1],a[2],……，a[n]
每次选一个数k及k个数1<=i[1]<i[2]<i[k]<=n，并将所有a[i[j]]变成a[i[j]]+1%m,求最少操作数，使a数组不变</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Toad Zitz has an array of integers, each integer is between $ 0 $ and $ m-1 $ inclusive. The integers are $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ .
In one operation Zitz can choose an integer $ k $ and $ k $ indices $ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k $ such that $ 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq n $ . He should then change $ a_{i_j} $ to $ ((a_{i_j}+1) \bmod m) $ for each chosen integer $ i_j $ . The integer $ m $ is fixed for all operations and indices.
Here $ x \bmod y $ denotes the remainder of the division of $ x $ by $ y $ .
Zitz wants to make his array non-decreasing with the minimum number of such operations. Find this minimum number of operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \leq n, m \leq 300\,000 $ ) — the number of integers in the array and the parameter $ m $ .
The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \leq a_i < m $ ) — the given array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer: the minimum number of described operations Zitz needs to make his array non-decreasing. If no operations required, print $ 0 $ .
It is easy to see that with enough operations Zitz can always make his array non-decreasing.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the array is already non-decreasing, so the answer is $ 0 $ .
In the second example, you can choose $ k=2 $ , $ i_1 = 2 $ , $ i_2 = 5 $ , the array becomes $ [0,0,1,3,3] $ . It is non-decreasing, so the answer is $ 1 $ .</div>
