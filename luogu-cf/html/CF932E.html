<h1>Team Work</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求$\sum_{i=1}^n C(n,i)*i^k$
by @ObsdianGungnir </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a team of $ N $ people. For a particular task, you can pick any non-empty subset of people. The cost of having $ x $ people for the task is $ x^{k} $ .
Output the sum of costs over all non-empty subsets of people.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Only line of input contains two integers $ N $ $ (1<=N<=10^{9}) $ representing total number of people and $ k $ $ (1<=k<=5000) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the sum of costs for all non empty subsets modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>24
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, there is only one non-empty subset $ {1} $ with cost $ 1^{1}=1 $ .
In the second example, there are seven non-empty subsets.
\- $ {1} $ with cost $ 1^{2}=1 $
\- $ {2} $ with cost $ 1^{2}=1 $
\- $ {1,2} $ with cost $ 2^{2}=4 $
\- $ {3} $ with cost $ 1^{2}=1 $
\- $ {1,3} $ with cost $ 2^{2}=4 $
\- $ {2,3} $ with cost $ 2^{2}=4 $
\- $ {1,2,3} $ with cost $ 3^{2}=9 $
The total cost is $ 1+1+4+1+4+4+9=24 $ .</div>
