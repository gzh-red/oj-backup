<h1>The Rank</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>约翰·史密斯知道他的儿子托马斯·史密斯是全班乃至全校最好的学生。在学校的英语、德语、数学和历史考试结束后得出了一个成绩单。
整个学校一共有$n$个学生，每名学生都有一个独立的id（id的值从1到n）。输入时学生的四科成绩按照id值从小到大的顺序依次输入。总分最高者为第一名。并且托马斯·史密斯的id=1。
求托马斯·史密斯的排名。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>John Smith knows that his son, Thomas Smith, is among the best students in his class and even in his school. After the students of the school took the exams in English, German, Math, and History, a table of results was formed.
There are $ n $ students, each of them has a unique id (from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ). Thomas's id is $ 1 $ . Every student has four scores correspond to his or her English, German, Math, and History scores. The students are given in order of increasing of their ids.
In the table, the students will be sorted by decreasing the sum of their scores. So, a student with the largest sum will get the first place. If two or more students have the same sum, these students will be sorted by increasing their ids.
Please help John find out the rank of his son.</div>
