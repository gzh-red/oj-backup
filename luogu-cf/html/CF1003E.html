<h1>Tree Constructing</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given three integers $ n $ , $ d $ and $ k $ .
Your task is to construct an undirected tree on $ n $ vertices with diameter $ d $ and degree of each vertex at most $ k $ , or say that it is impossible.
An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $ n - 1 $ edges.
Diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between all pairs of vertices of this tree.
Degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to this vertex (i.e. for a vertex $ u $ it is the number of edges $ (u, v) $ that belong to the tree, where $ v $ is any other vertex of a tree).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ d $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n, d, k \le 4 \cdot 10^5 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no tree satisfying the conditions above, print only one word "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), and then print $ n - 1 $ lines describing edges of a tree satisfying the conditions above. Vertices of the tree must be numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . You can print edges and vertices connected by an edge in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
