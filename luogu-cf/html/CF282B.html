<h1>Painting Eggs</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 问题描述
有$n$ 个蛋，A和G需要给这$n$ 个鸡蛋涂色。A涂第$i$ 个鸡蛋得到的钱为$A_i$ ，G涂第$i$ 个鸡蛋得到的钱为$G_i$ ，且满足$A_i+G_i=1000$ 。需要把这$n$ 个鸡蛋分配给A和G，求怎样分配使得A和G得到的钱$S_A$ 和$S_G$ 的差不超过$500$ 。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
第一行一个整数$n(1\le n\le 10^6)$ 。
接下来$n$ 行，每行两个整数$A_i,G_i(0\le A_i,G_i\le 1000,A_i+G_i=1000)$ 。
### 输出格式：
一行，长度为$n$ 的字符串，第$i$ 个字符为A或G，表示分配方案。
有多种解输出任意一种，需要满足$|S_A-S_G|\le 500$ 。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Bitlandians are quite weird people. They have very peculiar customs.
As is customary, Uncle J. wants to have $ n $ eggs painted for Bitruz (an ancient Bitland festival). He has asked G. and A. to do the work.
The kids are excited because just as is customary, they're going to be paid for the job!
Overall uncle J. has got $ n $ eggs. G. named his price for painting each egg. Similarly, A. named his price for painting each egg. It turns out that for each egg the sum of the money both A. and G. want for the painting equals $ 1000 $ .
Uncle J. wants to distribute the eggs between the children so as to give each egg to exactly one child. Also, Uncle J. wants the total money paid to A. to be different from the total money paid to G. by no more than $ 500 $ .
Help Uncle J. Find the required distribution of eggs or otherwise say that distributing the eggs in the required manner is impossible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{6}) $ — the number of eggs.
Next $ n $ lines contain two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ g_{i} $ each $ (0<=a_{i},g_{i}<=1000; a_{i}+g_{i}=1000) $ : $ a_{i} $ is the price said by A. for the $ i $ -th egg and $ g_{i} $ is the price said by G. for the $ i $ -th egg.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to assign the painting, print "-1" (without quotes).
Otherwise print a string, consisting of $ n $ letters "G" and "A". The $ i $ -th letter of this string should represent the child who will get the $ i $ -th egg in the required distribution. Letter "A" represents A. and letter "G" represents G. If we denote the money Uncle J. must pay A. for the painting as $ S_{a} $ , and the money Uncle J. must pay G. for the painting as $ S_{g} $ , then this inequality must hold: $ |S_{a}-S_{g}|<=500 $ .
If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
