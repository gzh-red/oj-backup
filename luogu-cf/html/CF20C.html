<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意
给出一张图，请输出其中任意一条可行的从点 $1$ 到点 $n$ 的最短路径。
输入输出格式
输入格式
第一行：两个整数n，m，分别表示点数和边数
接下来m行：每行三个整数u，v，w，表示u和v之间连一条边权为w的双向边。
输出格式
一行：一个可行的路径，如果不存在这种路径输出-1
2<=n<=10^5，0<=m<=10^5</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a weighted undirected graph. The vertices are enumerated from 1 to $ n $ . Your task is to find the shortest path between the vertex $ 1 $ and the vertex $ n $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5},0<=m<=10^{5} $ ), where $ n $ is the number of vertices and $ m $ is the number of edges. Following $ m $ lines contain one edge each in form $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n,1<=w_{i}<=10^{6} $ ), where $ a_{i},b_{i} $ are edge endpoints and $ w_{i} $ is the length of the edge.
It is possible that the graph has loops and multiple edges between pair of vertices.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Write the only integer -1 in case of no path. Write the shortest path in opposite case. If there are many solutions, print any of them.</div>
