<h1>Binary Protocol</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>解码一个`01串`，这个串的原文是一个数，编码规则如下：
- 每个数字用“1”字符的数字表示，该字符数等于该数字的值（对于0，它是0的数字）。
- 数字按顺序逐个写入，并以单个“0”字符分隔。
输入数据第一行为串的长度，第二行为串。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp has just invented a new binary protocol for data transmission. He is encoding positive integer decimal number to binary string using following algorithm:
- Each digit is represented with number of '1' characters equal to the value of that digit (for 0 it is zero ones).
- Digits are written one by one in order corresponding to number and separated by single '0' character.
Though Polycarp learnt how to encode the numbers, he has no idea how to decode them back. Help him calculate the decoded number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=89 $ ) — length of the string $ s $ .
The second line contains string $ s $ — sequence of '0' and '1' characters, number in its encoded format. It is guaranteed that the number corresponding to the string is positive and doesn't exceed $ 10^{9} $ . The string always starts with '1'.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the decoded number.</div>
