<h1>Boulevard</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Welcoming autumn evening is the best for walking along the boulevard and $ n $ people decided to do so.
The boulevard can be represented as the axis $ Ox $ . For every person there are three parameters characterizing the behavior: $ t_{i},s_{i},f_{i} $ — the moment of time when the $ i $ -th person starts walking, the start point and the end point of the walk respectively. Each person moves in a straight line along the boulevard from $ s_{i} $ to $ f_{i} $ with a constant speed of either 1 or $ -1 $ depending on the direction.
When the $ i $ -th person appears on the boulevard at the point $ s_{i} $ she immediately starts walking towards the point $ f_{i} $ .
If two or more persons meet at the boulevard (they are at the same point at the same time, no matter which directions they are going) they all greet each other. Like in the normal life, every pair of people greet each other at most once.
You task is to calculate for every person how many people she greets while walking along the boulevard.
Please, pay attention to the fact that $ i $ -th person may meet and greet any other person at points $ s_{i} $ and $ f_{i} $ . After a person achieves the destination point $ f_{i} $ she moves out of the boulevard and cannot greet anyone else. The same rule applies to the start of the walk: a person cannot greet anyone until she appears on the boulevard.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line there is an integer $ n $ $ (2<=n<=1000) $ — the number of people who decided to go for a walk.
The following $ n $ lines contain parameters for $ n $ people. In the $ i $ -th line there are three positive integers $ t_{i},s_{i},f_{i} $ $ (1<=t_{i},s_{i},f_{i}<=10^{6},s_{i}≠f_{i}) $ , where $ t_{i},s_{i},f_{i} $ — the moment of time when the $ i $ -th person starts walking, the start point and the end point of the walk respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line of the output should contain a sequence of $ n $ integers $ r_{1},r_{2},...,r_{n} $ separated by a space, where $ r_{i} $ denotes the number which the $ i $ -th person greets other people while walking along the boulevard.</div>
