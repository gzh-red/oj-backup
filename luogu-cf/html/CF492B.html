<h1>Vanya and Lanterns</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题意简述
⼀个⻓为$ L$ 的街道（左端点是 $0$，右端点是$ L$）上有 $n $个相
同的灯，第$ i$ 个灯放置的位置是 $a_i$。
• 问灯的半径⾄少要是多少，才能使得整个街道都有灯光。
## 数据范围
•$ n <= 1000, L <= 10^9$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya walks late at night along a straight street of length $ l $ , lit by $ n $ lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point $ 0 $ , and its end corresponding to the point $ l $ . Then the $ i $ -th lantern is at the point $ a_{i} $ . The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most $ d $ from it, where $ d $ is some positive number, common for all lanterns.
Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius $ d $ should the lanterns have to light the whole street?</div>
