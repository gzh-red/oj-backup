<h1>Tape</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>先给你n,m,k,分别表示点数，总长度，胶带的数量
再给你n个点，保证递增。
求覆盖所有的点所需的最小胶带长度（胶带数量<=k）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a long stick, consisting of $ m $ segments enumerated from $ 1 $ to $ m $ . Each segment is $ 1 $ centimeter long. Sadly, some segments are broken and need to be repaired.
You have an infinitely long repair tape. You want to cut some pieces from the tape and use them to cover all of the broken segments. To be precise, a piece of tape of integer length $ t $ placed at some position $ s $ will cover segments $ s, s+1, \ldots, s+t-1 $ .
You are allowed to cover non-broken segments; it is also possible that some pieces of tape will overlap.
Time is money, so you want to cut at most $ k $ continuous pieces of tape to cover all the broken segments. What is the minimum total length of these pieces?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ , $ n \le m \le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \le k \le n $ ) — the number of broken segments, the length of the stick and the maximum number of pieces you can use.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n $ ( $ 1 \le b_i \le m $ ) — the positions of the broken segments. These integers are given in increasing order, that is, $ b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum total length of the pieces.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, you can use a piece of length $ 11 $ to cover the broken segments $ 20 $ and $ 30 $ , and another piece of length $ 6 $ to cover $ 75 $ and $ 80 $ , for a total length of $ 17 $ .
In the second example, you can use a piece of length $ 4 $ to cover broken segments $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ , and two pieces of length $ 1 $ to cover broken segments $ 60 $ and $ 87 $ .</div>
