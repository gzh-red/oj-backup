<h1>Random Task</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：
求满足n+1~2n之间恰有m个数二进制表示中有k个1的n，输出任意一个解即可。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day, after a difficult lecture a diligent student Sasha saw a graffitied desk in the classroom. She came closer and read: "Find such positive integer $ n $ , that among numbers $ n+1 $ , $ n+2 $ , ..., $ 2·n $ there are exactly $ m $ numbers which binary representation contains exactly $ k $ digits one".
The girl got interested in the task and she asked you to help her solve it. Sasha knows that you are afraid of large numbers, so she guaranteed that there is an answer that doesn't exceed $ 10^{18} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers, $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 0<=m<=10^{18} $ ; $ 1<=k<=64 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the required number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{18} $ ). If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
