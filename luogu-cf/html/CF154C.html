<h1>Double Profiles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一张无向图,问有多少点对(A,B)的边完全相同. N,M ≤ 100000
A,B出边相同，当且仅当A连接的每一条边的另一个端点也和B直接相连 B连接的每一条边的另一个端点也和A相连
若A,B直接相连，不妨碍以上性质</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have been offered a job in a company developing a large social network. Your first task is connected with searching profiles that most probably belong to the same user.
The social network contains $ n $ registered profiles, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Some pairs there are friends (the "friendship" relationship is mutual, that is, if $ i $ is friends with $ j $ , then $ j $ is also friends with $ i $ ). Let's say that profiles $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ i≠j $ ) are doubles, if for any profile $ k $ ( $ k≠i $ , $ k≠j $ ) one of the two statements is true: either $ k $ is friends with $ i $ and $ j $ , or $ k $ isn't friends with either of them. Also, $ i $ and $ j $ can be friends or not be friends.
Your task is to count the number of different unordered pairs ( $ i,j $ ), such that the profiles $ i $ and $ j $ are doubles. Note that the pairs are unordered, that is, pairs ( $ a,b $ ) and ( $ b,a $ ) are considered identical.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ , $ 0<=m<=10^{6} $ ), — the number of profiles and the number of pairs of friends, correspondingly.
Next $ m $ lines contains descriptions of pairs of friends in the format " $ v\ u $ ", where $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1<=v,u<=n,v≠u $ ) are numbers of profiles that are friends with each other. It is guaranteed that each unordered pair of friends occurs no more than once and no profile is friends with itself.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single integer — the number of unordered pairs of profiles that are doubles.
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the %I64d specificator.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first and second sample any two profiles are doubles.
In the third sample the doubles are pairs of profiles $ (1,3) $ and $ (2,4) $ .</div>
