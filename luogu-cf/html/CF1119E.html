<h1>Pavel and Triangles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定n种木棍，第i+1种有ai​个，长度为2^i，求用这些木棍可以**同时**拼出多少个三角形（不可重复使用同一根）
输入第一行n，第二行n个整数a0,a1,a2...an−1
n≤3∗10^5,0≤ai≤10^9
输出一个整数表示个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Pavel has several sticks with lengths equal to powers of two.
He has $ a_0 $ sticks of length $ 2^0 = 1 $ , $ a_1 $ sticks of length $ 2^1 = 2 $ , ..., $ a_{n-1} $ sticks of length $ 2^{n-1} $ .
Pavel wants to make the maximum possible number of triangles using these sticks. The triangles should have strictly positive area, each stick can be used in at most one triangle.
It is forbidden to break sticks, and each triangle should consist of exactly three sticks.
Find the maximum possible number of triangles.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 300\,000 $ ) — the number of different lengths of sticks.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_0 $ , $ a_1 $ , ..., $ a_{n-1} $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the number of sticks with the length equal to $ 2^i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of non-degenerate triangles that Pavel can make.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, Pavel can, for example, make this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): $ (2^0, 2^4, 2^4) $ , $ (2^1, 2^3, 2^3) $ , $ (2^1, 2^2, 2^2) $ .
In the second example, Pavel cannot make a single triangle.
In the third example, Pavel can, for example, create this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): $ (2^0, 2^0, 2^0) $ , $ (2^1, 2^1, 2^1) $ , $ (2^2, 2^2, 2^2) $ .</div>
