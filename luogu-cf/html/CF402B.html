<h1>Trees in a Row</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题意
有$n$个正整数，可以对一个数进行修改(修改后也是正整数)，要求修改之后满足$a_i+k=a_{i+1}$,求最少的修改次数以及具体的修改方案
## 输入格式
第一行:$n$和$k$
第二行:$n$个数,表示初始的$a_i$
## 输出格式
若不用修改,只要输出0
若需要修改;
- 第一行:最小的修改次数
- 接下来的若干行,对于**被修改的**$a_i$,其修改后值为$b_i$,若$b_i>a_i$,输出:"+ i ($b_i-a_i$)";若$a_i>b_i$,输出:"- i $(a_i-b_i)$"
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Queen of England has $ n $ trees growing in a row in her garden. At that, the $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=n) $ tree from the left has height $ a_{i} $ meters. Today the Queen decided to update the scenery of her garden. She wants the trees' heights to meet the condition: for all $ i $ $ (1<=i&lt;n) $ , $ a_{i+1}-a_{i}=k $ , where $ k $ is the number the Queen chose.
Unfortunately, the royal gardener is not a machine and he cannot fulfill the desire of the Queen instantly! In one minute, the gardener can either decrease the height of a tree to any positive integer height or increase the height of a tree to any positive integer height. How should the royal gardener act to fulfill a whim of Her Majesty in the minimum number of minutes?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers: $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=1000) $ . The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=1000 $ ) — the heights of the trees in the row.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print a single integer $ p $ — the minimum number of minutes the gardener needs. In the next $ p $ lines print the description of his actions.
If the gardener needs to increase the height of the $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) tree from the left by $ x $ $ (x>=1) $ meters, then print in the corresponding line "+ j x". If the gardener needs to decrease the height of the $ j $ -th ( $ 1<=j<=n $ ) tree from the left by $ x $ $ (x>=1) $ meters, print on the corresponding line "- j x".
If there are multiple ways to make a row of trees beautiful in the minimum number of actions, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
