<h1>Three Garlands</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
圣诞树上有三个花环，Mishka将开启这些花环。
有时候花环会亮，有时候不会。如果第i个花环在第x秒开启，则仅在以第x,x+ki,x+2*ki……秒时是亮的。
Mishka想要打开花环，以便在每秒至少有一个点亮的花环。 在米什卡想要选择三个整数x1,x2,x3，以便在第x1秒期间接通第一个花环，在第x2秒期间接通第二个花环，并且在第x3秒期间接通第三个花环， 并且在从max（x1，x2，x3）开始的每秒中，至少一个花环将被点亮。
帮助米什卡告诉她是否有可能做到这一点。
输入
一行，3个整数，k1，k2，k3。（1<=k1,k2,k3<=1500）
输出
一行，若可以输出“YES”，不可以则输出“NO”（不包括引号）
样例解释
在第一例中，则可选择x1=1，x2=2，x3=1。
第一个花环将在第1,3,5,7,…秒是亮着的。
第二个花环将在第2,4,6,8,…秒是亮着的。
第三个花环将在第1,4,7,10,…秒是亮着的。
根据题意，在第2秒后，每秒都将有灯亮着，输出 YES 。
在第二例中，无解，输出 NO 。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.
When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if $ i $ -th garland is switched on during $ x $ -th second, then it is lit only during seconds $ x $ , $ x+k_{i} $ , $ x+2k_{i} $ , $ x+3k_{i} $ and so on.
Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ and $ x_{3} $ (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during $ x_{1} $ -th second, the second one — during $ x_{2} $ -th second, and the third one — during $ x_{3} $ -th second, respectively, and during each second starting from $ max(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) $ at least one garland will be lit.
Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ k_{1} $ , $ k_{2} $ and $ k_{3} $ ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=1500 $ ) — time intervals of the garlands.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.
Otherwise, print NO.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Mishka can choose $ x_{1}=1 $ , $ x_{2}=2 $ , $ x_{3}=1 $ . The first garland will be lit during seconds $ 1,3,5,7,... $ , the second — $ 2,4,6,8,... $ , which already cover all the seconds after the $ 2 $ -nd one. It doesn't even matter what $ x_{3} $ is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds $ 1,4,7,10,... $ , though.
In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.</div>
