<h1>Mother of Dragons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目简述
给你一个 n 个点的简单无向图（无重边无自环）。
你需要给每一个点 u 分配一个非负实数作为权值，要求权值总和为 K。
分配权值之后，每条无向边 䛨᡽ 产生 ᡽的价值。
请选择一种分配方式使得每条无向边产生的价值总和最大。你只需要输出这个答案。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ castles in the Lannister's Kingdom and some walls connect two castles, no two castles are connected by more than one wall, no wall connects a castle to itself.
Sir Jaime Lannister has discovered that Daenerys Targaryen is going to attack his kingdom soon. Therefore he wants to defend his kingdom. He has $ k $ liters of a strange liquid. He wants to distribute that liquid among the castles, so each castle may contain some liquid (possibly zero or non-integer number of liters). After that the stability of a wall is defined as follows: if the wall connects two castles $ a $ and $ b $ , and they contain $ x $ and $ y $ liters of that liquid, respectively, then the strength of that wall is $ x·y $ .
Your task is to print the maximum possible sum of stabilities of the walls that Sir Jaime Lannister can achieve.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=40 $ , $ 1<=k<=1000 $ ).
Then $ n $ lines follows. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i,1},a_{i,2},...,a_{i,n} $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF839E/42fca4c4e603f2c032708507d03d70b2d0fe668e.png)). If castles $ i $ and $ j $ are connected by a wall, then $ a_{i,j}=1 $ . Otherwise it is equal to $ 0 $ .
It is guaranteed that $ a_{i,j}=a_{j,i} $ and $ a_{i,i}=0 $ for all $ 1<=i,j<=n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible sum of stabilities of the walls that Sir Jaime Lannister can achieve.
Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .
Namely: let's assume that your answer is $ a $ , and the answer of the jury is $ b $ . The checker program will consider your answer correct, if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF839E/c5d4f85807f95b08a3db7aae534822038a5bf1df.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, we can assign $ 0.5,0.5,0 $ liters of liquid to castles $ 1,2,3 $ , respectively, to get the maximum sum ( $ 0.25 $ ).
In the second sample, we can assign $ 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 $ liters of liquid to castles $ 1,2,3,4 $ , respectively, to get the maximum sum ( $ 4.0 $ )</div>
