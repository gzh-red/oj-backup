<h1>Delivering Carcinogen</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Qwerty the Ranger arrived to the Diatar system with a very important task. He should deliver a special carcinogen for scientific research to planet Persephone. This is urgent, so Qwerty has to get to the planet as soon as possible. A lost day may fail negotiations as nobody is going to pay for an overdue carcinogen.
You can consider Qwerty's ship, the planet Persephone and the star Diatar points on a plane. Diatar is located in the origin of coordinate axes — at point $ (0,0) $ . Persephone goes round Diatar along a circular orbit with radius $ R $ in the counter-clockwise direction at constant linear speed $ v_{p} $ (thus, for instance, a full circle around the star takes ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF198C/7f71d7fc5fa093338f75a2945295efbc06437170.png) of time). At the initial moment of time Persephone is located at point $ (x_{p},y_{p}) $ .
At the initial moment of time Qwerty's ship is at point $ (x,y) $ . Qwerty can move in any direction at speed of at most $ v $ ( $ v&gt;v_{p} $ ). The star Diatar is hot (as all stars), so Qwerty can't get too close to it. The ship's metal sheathing melts at distance $ r $ ( $ r&lt;R $ ) from the star.
Find the minimum time Qwerty needs to get the carcinogen to planet Persephone.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains space-separated integers $ x_{p} $ , $ y_{p} $ and $ v_{p} $ ( $ -10^{4}<=x_{p},y_{p}<=10^{4} $ , $ 1<=v_{p}&lt;10^{4} $ ) — Persephone's initial position and the speed at which it goes round Diatar.
The second line contains space-separated integers $ x $ , $ y $ , $ v $ and $ r $ ( $ -10^{4}<=x,y<=10^{4} $ , $ 1&lt;v<=10^{4} $ , $ 1<=r<=10^{4} $ ) — The intial position of Qwerty's ship, its maximum speed and the minimum safe distance to star Diatar.
It is guaranteed that $ r^{2}&lt;x^{2}+y^{2} $ , $ r^{2}&lt;x_{p}^{2}+y_{p}^{2} $ and $ v_{p}&lt;v $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single real number — the minimum possible delivery time. The answer will be considered valid if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
