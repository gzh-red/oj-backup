<h1>Vectors</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你三个向量a,b,c,已知有2种操作:把a旋转90度,或把a加上c.这两种操作都可以进行任意次.问能否把a变成b.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>At a geometry lesson Gerald was given a task: to get vector $ B $ out of vector $ A $ . Besides, the teacher permitted him to perform the following operations with vector $ А $ :
- Turn the vector by $ 90 $ degrees clockwise.
- Add to the vector a certain vector $ C $ .
Operations could be performed in any order any number of times.
Can Gerald cope with the task?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ x_{1} $ и $ y_{1} $ — the coordinates of the vector $ A $ ( $ -10^{8}<=x_{1},y_{1}<=10^{8} $ ). The second and the third line contain in the similar manner vectors $ B $ and $ C $ (their coordinates are integers; their absolute value does not exceed $ 10^{8} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to get vector $ B $ using the given operations. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
