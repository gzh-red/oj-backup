<h1>Sasha Circle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定平面上两组整点，问是否存在一个圆，满足其中一组点均在圆内 (含边界)，另外一组点均在圆外 (不含边界)。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Berlanders like to eat cones after a hard day. Misha Square and Sasha Circle are local authorities of Berland. Each of them controls its points of cone trade. Misha has $ n $ points, Sasha — $ m $ . Since their subordinates constantly had conflicts with each other, they decided to build a fence in the form of a circle, so that the points of trade of one businessman are strictly inside a circle, and points of the other one are strictly outside. It doesn't matter which of the two gentlemen will have his trade points inside the circle.
Determine whether they can build a fence or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10000) $ , numbers of Misha's and Sasha's trade points respectively.
The next $ n $ lines contains pairs of space-separated integers $ M_{x},M_{y} $ ( $ -10^{4}<=M_{x},M_{y}<=10^{4} $ ), coordinates of Misha's trade points.
The next $ m $ lines contains pairs of space-separated integers $ S_{x},S_{y} $ ( $ -10^{4}<=S_{x},S_{y}<=10^{4} $ ), coordinates of Sasha's trade points.
It is guaranteed that all $ n+m $ points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only output line should contain either word "YES" without quotes in case it is possible to build a such fence or word "NO" in the other case.</div>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>YES

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample there is no possibility to separate points, because any circle that contains both points $ (-1,0),(1,0) $ also contains at least one point from the set $ (0,-1),(0,1) $ , and vice-versa: any circle that contains both points $ (0,-1),(0,1) $ also contains at least one point from the set $ (-1,0),(1,0) $
In the second sample one of the possible solution is shown below. Misha's points are marked with red colour and Sasha's are marked with blue. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF549E/7cc456c6f71deedb773a94ec144bb6683bf4aac0.png)</div>
