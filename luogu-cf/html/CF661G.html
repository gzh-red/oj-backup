<h1>Hungarian Notation【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In Hungarian notation, a variable name is prefixed with a letter or a group of letters which are mnemonics for the type of that variable. For the purposes of this problem we will consider only two data types: integer and real.
You are given the meaningful part of variable name in lowercase and a sample value that it will store. Integer values will be written as a sequence of digits. Real values will be written using fixed-point notation: the value is represented with a mandatory decimal point, one or more digits in the decimal part and without exponent part.
Your task is to construct a name of this variable in Hungarian notation in the following way. Convert the first letter of meaningful part of the name to uppercase, and prepend a prefix: 'i' for integer variables and 'f' for real ones.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a string of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of the string will be between $ 1 $ and $ 10 $ , inclusive.
The second line of the input contains a string of digits and zero or one decimal point '.'. The length of the string will be between $ 1 $ and $ 11 $ , inclusive. It's guaranteed that the decimal point '.' will not be the last character of the string.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single string — the name of the variable in Hungarian notation.</div>
