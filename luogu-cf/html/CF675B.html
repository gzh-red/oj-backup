<h1>Restoring Painting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya works as a watchman in the gallery. Unfortunately, one of the most expensive paintings was stolen while he was on duty. He doesn't want to be fired, so he has to quickly restore the painting. He remembers some facts about it.
- The painting is a square $ 3×3 $ , each cell contains a single integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , and different cells may contain either different or equal integers.
- The sum of integers in each of four squares $ 2×2 $ is equal to the sum of integers in the top left square $ 2×2 $ .
- Four elements $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ and $ d $ are known and are located as shown on the picture below.

Two squares are considered to be different, if there exists a cell that contains two different integers in different squares.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains five integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=a,b,c,d<=n $ ) — maximum possible value of an integer in the cell and four integers that Vasya remembers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the number of distinct valid squares.</div>
