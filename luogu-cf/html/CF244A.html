<h1>Dividing Orange</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day Ms Swan bought an orange in a shop. The orange consisted of $ n·k $ segments, numbered with integers from 1 to $ n·k $ .
There were $ k $ children waiting for Ms Swan at home. The children have recently learned about the orange and they decided to divide it between them. For that each child took a piece of paper and wrote the number of the segment that he would like to get: the $ i $ -th $ (1<=i<=k) $ child wrote the number $ a_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n·k) $ . All numbers $ a_{i} $ accidentally turned out to be different.
Now the children wonder, how to divide the orange so as to meet these conditions:
- each child gets exactly $ n $ orange segments;
- the $ i $ -th child gets the segment with number $ a_{i} $ for sure;
- no segment goes to two children simultaneously.
Help the children, divide the orange and fulfill the requirements, described above.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=30) $ . The second line contains $ k $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n·k) $ , where $ a_{i} $ is the number of the orange segment that the $ i $ -th child would like to get.
It is guaranteed that all numbers $ a_{i} $ are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly $ n·k $ distinct integers. The first $ n $ integers represent the indexes of the segments the first child will get, the second $ n $ integers represent the indexes of the segments the second child will get, and so on. Separate the printed numbers with whitespaces.
You can print a child's segment indexes in any order. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.</div>
