<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一棵树，共有N($ 1<=n<=10^5$)个节点，他会使用下列DFS算法对该树进行遍历。
```
starting_time是一个容量为n的数组
current_time = 0
dfs(v):
current_time =current_time+1
starting_time[v] = current_time
将children[v]的顺序随机排列 (每个排列的概率相同)
// children[v]v的直接儿子组成的数组
for u in children[v]:
dfs(u)
```
1是这棵树的根，Bob会从1出发，即运行dfs(1)，现在他想知道每个点starting_time的期望值。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Barney lives in country USC (United States of Charzeh). USC has $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ through $ n $ and $ n-1 $ roads between them. Cities and roads of USC form a rooted tree (Barney's not sure why it is rooted). Root of the tree is the city number $ 1 $ . Thus if one will start his journey from city $ 1 $ , he can visit any city he wants by following roads.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF696B/ba3e1e6f719802c9fe4b318c8d8513024bc088eb.png)Some girl has stolen Barney's heart, and Barney wants to find her. He starts looking for in the root of the tree and (since he is Barney Stinson not a random guy), he uses a random DFS to search in the cities. A pseudo code of this algorithm is as follows:
`<br></br>let starting_time be an array of length n<br></br>current_time = 0<br></br>dfs(v):<br></br> current_time = current_time + 1<br></br> starting_time[v] = current_time<br></br> shuffle children[v] randomly (each permutation with equal possibility)<br></br> // children[v] is vector of children cities of city v<br></br> for u in children[v]:<br></br> dfs(u)<br></br>`As told before, Barney will start his journey in the root of the tree (equivalent to call dfs(1)).
Now Barney needs to pack a backpack and so he wants to know more about his upcoming journey: for every city $ i $ , Barney wants to know the expected value of starting\_time\[i\]. He's a friend of Jon Snow and knows nothing, that's why he asked for your help.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of cities in USC.
The second line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}&lt;i $ ), where $ p_{i} $ is the number of the parent city of city number $ i $ in the tree, meaning there is a road between cities numbered $ p_{i} $ and $ i $ in USC.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only line of output print $ n $ numbers, where $ i $ -th number is the expected value of starting\_time\[i\].
Your answer for each city will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
