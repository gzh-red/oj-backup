<h1>Ayoub and Lost Array</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>已知有一个长度为$n$($1\leq n\leq 2 \times 10^5$)的数列，每一个数的大小在$[l,r]$($1\leq l \leq r \leq 10^9$)之间。求出有多少种方案使得这个数列的和为$3$的倍数。答案对$10^9+7$取模。当然，如果无法组成任何一个合法的数列，答案即为$0$。
## 输入格式
一行三个正整数$n$,$l$,$r$
## 输出格式
一行，表示方案数模$10^9+7$的结果。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ayoub had an array $ a $ of integers of size $ n $ and this array had two interesting properties:
- All the integers in the array were between $ l $ and $ r $ (inclusive).
- The sum of all the elements was divisible by $ 3 $ .
Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array $ n $ and the numbers $ l $ and $ r $ , so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array.
Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ (i.e. the remainder when dividing by $ 10^9 + 7 $ ). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print $ 0 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line contains three integers $ n $ , $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le l \le r \le 10^9 $ ) — the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the remainder when dividing by $ 10^9 + 7 $ the number of ways to restore the array.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>

In the second example, the only possible array is $ [2, 2, 2] $ .</div>
