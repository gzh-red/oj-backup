<h1>kotlinkotlinkotlinkotlin...</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp really likes writing the word "kotlin". He wrote this word several times in a row without spaces. For example, he could write the string like "kotlinkotlinkotlinkotlin".
Polycarp sliced (cut) the written string into $ n $ pieces and mixed them. As a result, he has $ n $ strings $ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n $ and he can arrange them in the right order, concatenate (join) all of them and get a string like "kotlinkotlin...kotlin".
Help Polycarp to find the right order of strings $ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n $ , so that if he writes the strings in this order, he will get the word "kotlin" or the sequence of this word.
Pay attention that you must use all given strings and you must use each string only once.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of Polycarp's strings. Next lines of the input contain $ n $ Polycarp's strings.
Total sum of their lengths doesn't exceed $ 3\cdot10^5 $ . It's guaranteed that there is the right order of arrangement the strings that if you concatenate them into one string, you will get some non-empty sequence of the word "kotlin".</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ different integers $ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \le p_i \le n $ ), where $ p_i $ is an index of the string that should be the $ i $ -th in a required concatenation. In other words, the result of concatenation $ s_{p_1}+s_{p_2}+\dots+s_{p_n} $ must be in the form "kotlinkotlin...kotlin". If there are many solutions, print any of them.</div>
