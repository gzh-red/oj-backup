<h1>Heidi Learns Hashing (Hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Now Heidi is ready to crack Madame Kovarian's hashing function.
Madame Kovarian has a very strict set of rules for name changes. Two names can be interchanged only if using the following hashing function on them results in a collision. However, the hashing function is parametrized, so one can always find a set of parameters that causes such a collision. Heidi decided to exploit this to her advantage.
Given two strings $ w_1 $ , $ w_2 $ of equal length $ n $ consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer $ m $ .
Consider the standard polynomial hashing function:
$ H_p(w) := \left( \sum_{i=0}^{|w|-1} w_i r^i \right) \mbox{mod}(p) $
where $ p $ is some prime, and $ r $ is some number such that $ 2\leq r \leq p-2 $ .
The goal is to find $ r $ and a prime $ p $ ( $ m \leq p \leq 10^9 $ ) such that $ H_p(w_1) = H_p(w_2) $ .
Strings $ w_1 $ and $ w_2 $ are sampled independently at random from all strings of length $ n $ over lowercase English letters.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 10 \le n \le 10^5 $ , $ 2 \le m \le 10^5 $ ).
The second and the third line, respectively, contain the words $ w_1 $ , $ w_2 $ that were sampled independently at random from all strings of length $ n $ over lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output integers $ p, r $ .
$ p $ should be a prime in the range $ [m, 10^9] $ and $ r $ should be an integer satisfying $ r\in [2,p-2] $ .
At least one solution is guaranteed to exist. In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, note that even though $ p=3 $ and $ r=2 $ also causes a colision of hashes, it is not a correct solution, since $ m $ is $ 5 $ and thus we want $ p\geq 5 $ .
In the second example, we are aware of the extra 'g' at the end. We just didn't realize that "River Song" and "Melody Pond" have different lengths...</div>
