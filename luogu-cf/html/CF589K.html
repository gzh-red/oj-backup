<h1>Task processing</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya wants to create a computing system to process arbitrary tasks. As a part of the system he needs an algorithm which will choose an order of task execution.
He came up with the following algorithm:
- There is a single execution queue. For task to be completed, it needs to be added to the queue.
- For each task two values are known: $ l_{i} $ and $ t_{i} $ — the number of seconds that it takes to complete the task and the moment of time when this task is added to the execution queue.
- If at some moment of time $ T $ the algorithm has to select a task for execution, it picks the one with the minimum value of $ l_{i}-(T-t_{i})^{2} $ . In case of a tie, algorithm picks a task with the lowest index. Then for the following $ l_{i} $ seconds the algorithm will wait for the task to be completed.
In order to test the algorithm Vasya wants you to simulate it.
You are given $ n $ tasks. For each task, you know the number of seconds $ l_{i} $ that it takes to complete the task and the moment of time $ t_{i} $ when this task is added to the execution queue.
For each task find out the moment of time when it will be completed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer number $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of task to process. The next $ n $ lines contain two integers each: $ l_{i},t_{i} $ $ (1<=l_{i}<=10^{5},0<=t_{i}<=10^{5}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ space-separated integers. The $ i $ -th integer is the moment of time when the $ i $ -th task was completed.</div>
