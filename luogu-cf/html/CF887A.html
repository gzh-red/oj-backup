<h1>Div. 64</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
超模$Izabella$ 参加了比赛。她想要给评委留下深刻的印象并且展示她的数学技能。
她的问题如下：对于一个只由$0$ 和$1$ 组成的字符串，判断是否能删掉一些数字，使得得到的二进制数能被$64$ 整除。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
一行，为一个长度不超过$100$ 的$01$ 字符串。
### 输出格式：
如果可以，输出$yes$ ，否则输出$no$ 。
感谢@M_sea 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Top-model Izabella participates in the competition. She wants to impress judges and show her mathematical skills.
Her problem is following: for given string, consisting of only 0 and 1, tell if it's possible to remove some digits in such a way, that remaining number is a representation of some positive integer, divisible by 64, in the binary numerical system.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line given a non-empty binary string $ s $ with length up to $ 100 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print «yes» (without quotes) if it's possible to remove digits required way and «no» otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>100010001
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>yes</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>100
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>no</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case, you can get string $ 1\ 000\ 000 $ after removing two ones which is a representation of number $ 64 $ in the binary numerical system.
