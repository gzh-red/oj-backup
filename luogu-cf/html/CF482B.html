<h1>Interesting Array</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>构建一个序列a,满足m条限制.
限制形如<l,r,q>:
a[l]&a[l+1]&...&a[r-1]&a[r]=q;(此处'&'为位运算的and操作).
由 @Styx 提供翻译
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We'll call an array of $ n $ non-negative integers $ a\[1\],a\[2\],...,a\[n\] $ interesting, if it meets $ m $ constraints. The $ i $ -th of the $ m $ constraints consists of three integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ , $ q_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=n $ ) meaning that value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF482B/c5cfeb39e6b942f975aeab6674c1941b58030e74.png) should be equal to $ q_{i} $ .
Your task is to find any interesting array of $ n $ elements or state that such array doesn't exist.
Expression $ x&y $ means the bitwise AND of numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . In programming languages C++, Java and Python this operation is represented as "&", in Pascal — as "and".</div>
