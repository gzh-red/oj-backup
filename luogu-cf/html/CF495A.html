<h1>Digital Counter</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Malek lives in an apartment block with $ 100 $ floors numbered from $ 0 $ to $ 99 $ . The apartment has an elevator with a digital counter showing the floor that the elevator is currently on. The elevator shows each digit of a number with $ 7 $ light sticks by turning them on or off. The picture below shows how the elevator shows each digit.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF495A/82c4b2ab842edc90f41be56a97fcef1aaf93be0a.png)One day when Malek wanted to go from floor $ 88 $ to floor $ 0 $ using the elevator he noticed that the counter shows number $ 89 $ instead of $ 88 $ . Then when the elevator started moving the number on the counter changed to $ 87 $ . After a little thinking Malek came to the conclusion that there is only one explanation for this: One of the sticks of the counter was broken. Later that day Malek was thinking about the broken stick and suddenly he came up with the following problem.
Suppose the digital counter is showing number $ n $ . Malek calls an integer $ x $ ( $ 0<=x<=99 $ ) good if it's possible that the digital counter was supposed to show $ x $ but because of some(possibly none) broken sticks it's showing $ n $ instead. Malek wants to know number of good integers for a specific $ n $ . So you must write a program that calculates this number. Please note that the counter always shows two digits.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of input contains exactly two digits representing number $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=99 $ ). Note that $ n $ may have a leading zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line of the output print the number of good integers.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the counter may be supposed to show $ 88 $ or $ 89 $ .
In the second sample the good integers are $ 00 $ , $ 08 $ , $ 80 $ and $ 88 $ .
In the third sample the good integers are $ 03,08,09,33,38,39,73,78,79,83,88,89,93,98,99 $ .</div>
