<h1>Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有两个箱子，A箱子里有n1个球，B箱子里有n2个球。第一个人先从A箱子里取1~k1个球，第二个人再从B箱子里取1~k2个球，如此往复。先取完的人输掉游戏。输出赢的人。
【输入格式】：一行，四个数，n1,n2,k1,k2
【输出格式】：一行，第一个人赢输出"First",否则输出"Second"</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two players play a simple game. Each player is provided with a box with balls. First player's box contains exactly $ n_{1} $ balls and second player's box contains exactly $ n_{2} $ balls. In one move first player can take from 1 to $ k_{1} $ balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to $ k_{2} $ balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. The one who can't make a move loses. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers $ n_{1},n_{2},k_{1},k_{2} $ . All numbers in the input are from 1 to 50.
This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 3 points for the correct submission.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "First" if the first player wins and "Second" otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 2 1 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Second
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 1 1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>First
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the first sample test. Each player has a box with 2 balls. The first player draws a single ball from his box in one move and the second player can either take 1 or 2 balls from his box in one move. No matter how the first player acts, the second player can always win if he plays wisely.</div>
