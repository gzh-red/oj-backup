<h1>Another One Bites The Dust</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个字符串是好的当且仅当它只含'a'和'b'且相邻字符不相同。如"baba"和"aba"是好字符串，"abb"不是好字符串。
你有$a$个"a"，$b$个"b"，$c$个"ab"，从中选择一些拼接起来，求能得到的最长好字符串长度。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's call a string good if and only if it consists of only two types of letters — 'a' and 'b' and every two consecutive letters are distinct. For example "baba" and "aba" are good strings and "abb" is a bad string.
You have $ a $ strings "a", $ b $ strings "b" and $ c $ strings "ab". You want to choose some subset of these strings and concatenate them in any arbitrarily order.
What is the length of the longest good string you can obtain this way?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three positive integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ ( $ 1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9 $ ) — the number of strings "a", "b" and "ab" respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the maximum possible length of the good string you can obtain.</div>
