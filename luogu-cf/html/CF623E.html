<h1>Transforming Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于正整数序列$A$，定义序列$B$：
$B_1=A_1$
$B_i=B_{i-1}\ or\ A_i,i\in[2,n]$
其中$or$为位或运算。
每一个序列合法，满足对于$\forall i\in[1,n]$，有$A_i\in[1,2^k)$；而且对于$\forall i\in[2,n]$，有$B_i>B_{i-1}$。
给出$n(n<=10^{18})$，$k(k<=3*10^4)$，求合法序列数。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's define the transformation $ P $ of a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ as $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , where $ b_{i}=a_{1} | a_{2} | ... | a_{i} $ for all $ i=1,2,...,n $ , where $ | $ is the bitwise OR operation.
Vasya consequently applies the transformation $ P $ to all sequences of length $ n $ consisting of integers from $ 1 $ to $ 2^{k}-1 $ inclusive. He wants to know how many of these sequences have such property that their transformation is a strictly increasing sequence. Help him to calculate this number modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{18},1<=k<=30000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
