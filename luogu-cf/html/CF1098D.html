<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小V有一个水缸和一堆鱼，水缸初始是空的，小V接下来会向水缸内加入一些鱼，同时也可能将已加入的鱼捞出来。
水缸里的鱼会相互攻击，直到只有一条鱼为止。也就是说如果有n条鱼，则会发生n-1次攻击。 如果一条鱼的重量为A,另一条鱼重量为B，如果A<=B，则B鱼会吃掉A鱼，然后B鱼体重变为A+B。
对于一场攻击来说，如果一条鱼的重量为A,另一条鱼重量为B，如果AB满足条件 ：A<=B 而且 B<=2A 那么我们定义这场攻击是危险的。
现在小V会有q次操作，包括加入一条体重为x的鱼，或捞出一条水缸内的、体重为x的鱼。
小V想知道，在每次操作后，水缸内能发生的最多的危险攻击次数是多少。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya is a big fish lover, and his parents gave him an aquarium for the New Year. Vasya does not have a degree in ichthyology, so he thinks that filling a new aquarium with eels is a good idea. Unfortunately, eels are predators, so Vasya decided to find out how dangerous this idea was.
Getting into one aquarium, eels fight each other until exactly one fish remains. When two eels fight, the big one eats the smaller one (if their weights are equal, then one of them will still eat the other). Namely, let $ n $ eels be initially in an aquarium, and the $ i $ -th of them have a weight of $ x_i $ . Then $ n-1 $ battles will occur between them, as a result of which, only one eel will survive. In a battle of two eels with weights $ a $ and $ b $ , where $ a \le b $ , eel of weight $ a $ will be eaten and disappear from the aquarium, and eel of weight $ b $ will increase its weight to $ a+b $ .
A battle between two eels with weights $ a $ and $ b $ , where $ a \le b $ , is considered dangerous if $ b \le 2 a $ . For a given set of eels, danger is defined as the maximum number of dangerous battles that can occur among these eels if they are placed in one aquarium.
Now Vasya is planning, which eels he wants to put into an aquarium. He has some set of eels (initially empty). He makes a series of operations with this set. With each operation, he either adds one eel in the set, or removes one eel from the set. Vasya asks you to calculate the danger of the current set of eels after each operation.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 500\,000 $ ), the number of operations that Vasya makes. The next $ q $ lines describe operations. Each operation has one of two types :
- + x describes the addition of one eel of weight $ x $ to the set ( $ 1 \le x \le 10^9 $ ). Note that in the set there can be several eels of the same weight.
- - x describes the removal of one eel of weight $ x $ from a set, and it is guaranteed that there is a eel of such weight in the set.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each operation, output single integer, the danger of the set of eels after this operation.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the third example, after performing all the operations, the set of eels looks like $ \{1, 1, 4\} $ . For this set of eels, there are several possible scenarios, if all of them are placed in one aquarium:
- The eel of weight 4 eats the eel of weight 1, and then the second eel of weight 1. In this case, none of the battles are dangerous.
- The eel of weight 1 eats the eel of weight 1, and this battle is dangerous. Now there are two eels in the aquarium, their weights are 4 and 2. The big one eats the small one, and this battle is also dangerous. In this case, the total number of dangerous battles will be 2.
Thus, the danger of this set of eels is 2.</div>
