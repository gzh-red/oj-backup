<h1>The Child and Polygon</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$n$个点，求这个多边形的三角剖分的方案数
mod 1e9+7</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This time our child has a simple polygon. He has to find the number of ways to split the polygon into non-degenerate triangles, each way must satisfy the following requirements:
- each vertex of each triangle is one of the polygon vertex;
- each side of the polygon must be the side of exactly one triangle;
- the area of intersection of every two triangles equals to zero, and the sum of all areas of triangles equals to the area of the polygon;
- each triangle must be completely inside the polygon;
- each side of each triangle must contain exactly two vertices of the polygon.
The picture below depicts an example of a correct splitting.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF437E/a8e2701cc66365983a77c546adbf6d2315ebb4eb.png)Please, help the child. Calculate the described number of ways modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ for him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=200) $ — the number of vertices of the polygon. Then follow $ n $ lines, each line containing two integers. The $ i $ -th line contains $ x_{i},y_{i} $ $ (|x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{7}) $ — the $ i $ -th vertex of the polygon in clockwise or counterclockwise order.
It's guaranteed that the polygon is simple.</div>
