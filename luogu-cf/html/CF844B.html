<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个01矩阵，求有多少子点集满足：
1、点全是0或点全是1
2、点都在同一行或同一列上</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n×m $ table. Each cell of the table is colored white or black. Find the number of non-empty sets of cells such that:
1. All cells in a set have the same color.
2. Every two cells in a set share row or column.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=50 $ ) — the number of rows and the number of columns correspondingly.
The next $ n $ lines of input contain descriptions of rows. There are $ m $ integers, separated by spaces, in each line. The number equals $ 0 $ if the corresponding cell is colored white and equals $ 1 $ if the corresponding cell is colored black.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output single integer — the number of non-empty sets from the problem description.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 1
