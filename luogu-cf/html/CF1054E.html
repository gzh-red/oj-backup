<h1>Chips Puzzle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Egor came up with a new chips puzzle and suggests you to play.
The puzzle has the form of a table with $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns, each cell can contain several black or white chips placed in a row. Thus, the state of the cell can be described by a string consisting of characters '0' (a white chip) and '1' (a black chip), possibly empty, and the whole puzzle can be described as a table, where each cell is a string of zeros and ones. The task is to get from one state of the puzzle some other state.
To do this, you can use the following operation.
- select 2 different cells $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ : the cells must be in the same row or in the same column of the table, and the string in the cell $ (x_1, y_1) $ must be non-empty;
- in one operation you can move the last character of the string at the cell $ (x_1, y_1) $ to the beginning of the string at the cell $ (x_2, y_2) $ .
Egor came up with two states of the table for you: the initial state and the final one. It is guaranteed that the number of zeros and ones in the tables are the same. Your goal is with several operations get the final state from the initial state. Of course, Egor does not want the number of operations to be very large. Let's denote as $ s $ the number of characters in each of the tables (which are the same). Then you should use no more than $ 4 \cdot s $ operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \leq n, m \leq 300 $ ) — the number of rows and columns of the table, respectively.
The following $ n $ lines describe the initial state of the table in the following format: each line contains $ m $ non-empty strings consisting of zeros and ones. In the $ i $ -th of these lines, the $ j $ -th string is the string written at the cell $ (i, j) $ . The rows are enumerated from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the columns are numerated from $ 1 $ to $ m $ .
The following $ n $ lines describe the final state of the table in the same format.
Let's denote the total length of strings in the initial state as $ s $ . It is guaranteed that $ s \leq 100\, 000 $ . It is also guaranteed that the numbers of zeros and ones coincide in the initial and final states.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line print $ q $ — the number of operations used. You should find such a solution that $ 0 \leq q \leq 4 \cdot s $ .
In each the next $ q $ lines print 4 integers $ x_1 $ , $ y_1 $ , $ x_2 $ , $ y_2 $ . On the $ i $ -th line you should print the description of the $ i $ -th operation. These integers should satisfy the conditions $ 1 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq n $ , $ 1 \leq y_1, y_2 \leq m $ , $ (x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2) $ , $ x_1 = x_2 $ or $ y_1 = y_2 $ . The string in the cell $ (x_1, y_1) $ should be non-empty. This sequence of operations should transform the initial state of the table to the final one.
We can show that a solution exists. If there is more than one solution, find any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Consider the first example.
- The current state of the table:`<br></br>00 10<br></br>01 11<br></br>`The first operation. The cell $ (2, 1) $ contains the string $ 01 $ . Applying the operation to cells $ (2, 1) $ and $ (1, 1) $ , we move the $ 1 $ from the end of the string $ 01 $ to the beginning of the string $ 00 $ and get the string $ 100 $ .
- The current state of the table:`<br></br>100 10<br></br>0 11<br></br>`The second operation. The cell $ (1, 1) $ contains the string $ 100 $ . Applying the operation to cells $ (1, 1) $ and $ (1, 2) $ , we move the $ 0 $ from the end of the string $ 100 $ to the beginning of the string $ 10 $ and get the string $ 010 $ .
- The current state of the table:`<br></br>10 010<br></br>0 11<br></br>`The third operation. The cell $ (1, 2) $ contains the string $ 010 $ . Applying the operation to cells $ (1, 2) $ and $ (2, 2) $ , we move the $ 0 $ from the end of the string $ 010 $ to the beginning of the string $ 11 $ and get the string $ 011 $ .
- The current state of the table:`<br></br>10 01<br></br>0 011<br></br>`The fourth operation. The cell $ (2, 2) $ contains the string $ 011 $ . Applying the operation to cells $ (2, 2) $ and $ (2, 1) $ , we move the $ 1 $ from the end of the string $ 011 $ to the beginning of the string $ 0 $ and get the string $ 10 $ .
- The current state of the table:`<br></br>10 01<br></br>10 01<br></br>`
