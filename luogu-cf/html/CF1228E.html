<h1>Another Filling the Grid</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个n*n的矩阵，用1~k的数填充，每行每列最小值均为1，问有多少填法（mod1e9+7）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have $ n \times n $ square grid and an integer $ k $ . Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.
- All numbers in the grid should be between $ 1 $ and $ k $ inclusive.
- Minimum number of the $ i $ -th row is $ 1 $ ( $ 1 \le i \le n $ ).
- Minimum number of the $ j $ -th column is $ 1 $ ( $ 1 \le j \le n $ ).
Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo $ (10^{9} + 7) $ .
