<h1>Hometask</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Furik loves math lessons very much, so he doesn't attend them, unlike Rubik. But now Furik wants to get a good mark for math. For that Ms. Ivanova, his math teacher, gave him a new task. Furik solved the task immediately. Can you?
You are given a set of digits, your task is to find the maximum integer that you can make from these digits. The made number must be divisible by $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ without a residue. It is permitted to use not all digits from the set, it is forbidden to use leading zeroes.
Each digit is allowed to occur in the number the same number of times it occurs in the set.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=100000) $ — the number of digits in the set. The second line contains $ n $ digits, the digits are separated by a single space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line print the answer to the problem. If such number does not exist, then you should print -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample there is only one number you can make — 0. In the second sample the sought number is 5554443330. In the third sample it is impossible to make the required number.</div>
