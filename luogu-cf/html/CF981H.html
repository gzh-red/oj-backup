<h1>K Paths</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出有$n$ $(n <= 10^{5})$个点的树和 $n - 1$ 条边，并且可以选择$k$ $(k <= 10^{5})$个路径（所选路径可重并且****具有先后顺序****）， 满足所选的路径集合中所有被覆盖的边只被其中$k$个路径或$1$个路径覆盖，并且必须存在一条边被$k$个路径经过，求选择路径$Mod$ $998244353$的方案数。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree of $ n $ vertices. You are to select $ k $ (not necessarily distinct) simple paths in such a way that it is possible to split all edges of the tree into three sets: edges not contained in any path, edges that are a part of exactly one of these paths, and edges that are parts of all selected paths, and the latter set should be non-empty.
Compute the number of ways to select $ k $ paths modulo $ 998244353 $ .
The paths are enumerated, in other words, two ways are considered distinct if there are such $ i $ ( $ 1 \leq i \leq k $ ) and an edge that the $ i $ -th path contains the edge in one way and does not contain it in the other.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the desired number of paths.
The next $ n - 1 $ lines describe edges of the tree. Each line contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \le a, b \le n $ , $ a \ne b $ ) — the endpoints of an edge. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of ways to select $ k $ enumerated not necessarily distinct simple paths in such a way that for each edge either it is not contained in any path, or it is contained in exactly one path, or it is contained in all $ k $ paths, and the intersection of all paths is non-empty.
As the answer can be large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the following ways are valid：
- $ ((1,2), (1,2)) $ ,
- $ ((1,2), (1,3)) $ ,
- $ ((1,3), (1,2)) $ ,
- $ ((1,3), (1,3)) $ ,
- $ ((1,3), (2,3)) $ ,
- $ ((2,3), (1,3)) $ ,
- $ ((2,3), (2,3)) $ .
In the second example $ k=1 $ , so all $ n \cdot (n - 1) / 2 = 5 \cdot 4 / 2 = 10 $ paths are valid.
In the third example, the answer is $ \geq 998244353 $ , so it was taken modulo $ 998244353 $ , don't forget it!</div>
