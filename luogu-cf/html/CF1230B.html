<h1>Ania and Minimizing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>annie给了你一个长度为n的数字串，她想请你改动其中k个数字，要求保证在没有前导零的基础下是数字串最小
输入：
第一行为n，k（1≤n≤200000 , 0≤k≤n）
第二行为长度为n的数字串
输出：
改动后的数字串</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ania has a large integer $ S $ . Its decimal representation has length $ n $ and doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Ania is allowed to change at most $ k $ digits of $ S $ . She wants to do it in such a way that $ S $ still won't contain any leading zeroes and it'll be minimal possible. What integer will Ania finish with?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 200\,000 $ , $ 0 \leq k \leq n $ ) — the number of digits in the decimal representation of $ S $ and the maximum allowed number of changed digits.
The second line contains the integer $ S $ . It's guaranteed that $ S $ has exactly $ n $ digits and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the minimal possible value of $ S $ which Ania can end with. Note that the resulting integer should also have $ n $ digits.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A number has leading zeroes if it consists of at least two digits and its first digit is $ 0 $ . For example, numbers $ 00 $ , $ 00069 $ and $ 0101 $ have leading zeroes, while $ 0 $ , $ 3000 $ and $ 1010 $ don't have leading zeroes.</div>
