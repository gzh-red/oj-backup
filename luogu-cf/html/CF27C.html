<h1>Unordered Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题面描述】
如果一个序列是递增或递降的（相等也算增或降），则称它为有序的。给定一个序列，找出最长的非有序的子序列。子序列可以不连续。
【输入格式】
第1行，序列长度N。
第2行，N个数的序列。
【输出格式】
第1行，最长长度K。
第2行，K个数，表示最长非有序子序列中，每个数在原序列中的下标。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The sequence is called ordered if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, sequnces \[3, 1, 1, 0\] and \[1, 2, 3, 100\] are ordered, but the sequence \[1, 3, 3, 1\] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to find it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers — the given sequence. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed $ 10^{6} $ by absolute value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the given sequence does not contain any unordered subsequences, output $ 0 $ . Otherwise, output the length $ k $ of the shortest such subsequence. Then output $ k $ integers from the range \[1.. $ n $ \] — indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are several solutions, output any of them.</div>
