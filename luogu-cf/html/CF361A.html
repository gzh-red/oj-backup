<h1>Levko and Table</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Levko 很喜欢幻方，他想构造一个长宽都是 $n$ 且每行每列的和都是 $k$ 的幻方，请你帮帮他</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Levko loves tables that consist of $ n $ rows and $ n $ columns very much. He especially loves beautiful tables. A table is beautiful to Levko if the sum of elements in each row and column of the table equals $ k $ .
Unfortunately, he doesn't know any such table. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 1<=k<=1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print any beautiful table. Levko doesn't like too big numbers, so all elements of the table mustn't exceed $ 1000 $ in their absolute value.
If there are multiple suitable tables, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 3
3 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 1 0 4
4 0 2 1
1 3 3 0
0 3 2 2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the sum in the first row is $ 1+3=4 $ , in the second row — $ 3+1=4 $ , in the first column — $ 1+3=4 $ and in the second column — $ 3+1=4 $ . There are other beautiful tables for this sample.
In the second sample the sum of elements in each row and each column equals $ 7 $ . Besides, there are other tables that meet the statement requirements.</div>
