<h1>Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Vasya和Petya发明了一种新的游戏。首先画一个1×N的长方形，由N个1×1的黑（用1表示）白（用0表示）正方形组成。Petya可以任意选择两个相邻且同色的小正方形，并且把这两个小正方形任意地涂色（黑或白或一黑一白均可）。这就是一次操作。游戏的目标是使得任意两个相邻的小正方形不同色。请问：Petya至少需要操作几次？

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya and Petya have invented a new game. Vasya takes a stripe consisting of $ 1×n $ square and paints the squares black and white. After that Petya can start moves — during a move he may choose any two neighboring squares of one color and repaint these two squares any way he wants, perhaps in different colors. Petya can only repaint the squares in white and black colors. Petya’s aim is to repaint the stripe so that no two neighboring squares were of one color. Help Petya, using the given initial coloring, find the minimum number of moves Petya needs to win.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) which represents the stripe’s length. The second line contains exactly $ n $ symbols — the line’s initial coloring. 0 corresponds to a white square, 1 corresponds to a black one.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Petya cannot win with such an initial coloring, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves Petya needs to win.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample Petya can take squares 1 and 2. He repaints square 1 to black and square 2 to white.
In the second sample Petya can take squares 2 and 3. He repaints square 2 to white and square 3 to black.</div>
