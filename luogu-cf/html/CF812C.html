<h1>Sagheer and Nubian Market</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
Sagheer在去Luxor和 Aswan的旅途中去了Nubian市场给它的朋友和亲戚买纪念品。这个市场有一些奇怪的规则。市场上有$n$件商品，标号为$1$到$n$。第$i$件商品有一个基本花费为$a_{i}$埃及镑。如果Sagheer买了$k$件下标分别为$x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k}$的商品，那么第$j$件商品的实际花费就是$a_{xj}+x_{j}·k(1 <= j <= k)$换句话说，每件商品的实际花费就是它的基本花费加上(它的下标×总购买件数)
Sagheer想花最多$S$埃及镑来买尽量多的纪念品，注意它只能买同一种物品一件。如果有多种方式使纪念品数量最大，他会选择花费最小的方案。你能帮助他完成他的任务吗？
### 输入格式
第一行包含2个整数$n$和$S$ $(1 <= n <= 10^5 $且$1 <= S <= 10^9)$
第二行包含$n$个以空格分开的整数$a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}(1 <= a_{i} <= 10^5)$
### 输出格式
一行，输出2个整数$k$ - Sagheer最大能买到的纪念品数量和$T$ - 最小Sagheer的总花费。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>On his trip to Luxor and Aswan, Sagheer went to a Nubian market to buy some souvenirs for his friends and relatives. The market has some strange rules. It contains $ n $ different items numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th item has base cost $ a_{i} $ Egyptian pounds. If Sagheer buys $ k $ items with indices $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ , then the cost of item $ x_{j} $ is $ a_{xj}+x_{j}·k $ for $ 1<=j<=k $ . In other words, the cost of an item is equal to its base cost in addition to its index multiplied by the factor $ k $ .
Sagheer wants to buy as many souvenirs as possible without paying more than $ S $ Egyptian pounds. Note that he cannot buy a souvenir more than once. If there are many ways to maximize the number of souvenirs, he will choose the way that will minimize the total cost. Can you help him with this task?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ S $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ and $ 1<=S<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of souvenirs in the market and Sagheer's budget.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{5} $ ) — the base costs of the souvenirs.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On a single line, print two integers $ k $ , $ T $ — the maximum number of souvenirs Sagheer can buy and the minimum total cost to buy these $ k $ souvenirs.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, he cannot take the three items because they will cost him $ [5,9,14] $ with total cost $ 28 $ . If he decides to take only two items, then the costs will be $ [4,7,11] $ . So he can afford the first and second items.
In the second example, he can buy all items as they will cost him $ [5,10,17,22] $ .
In the third example, there is only one souvenir in the market which will cost him $ 8 $ pounds, so he cannot buy it.</div>
