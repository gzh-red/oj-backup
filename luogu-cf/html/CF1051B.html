<h1>Relatively Prime Pairs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a set of all integers from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive, $ l < r $ , $ (r - l + 1) \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ and $ (r - l) $ is always odd.
You want to split these numbers into exactly $ \frac{r - l + 1}{2} $ pairs in such a way that for each pair $ (i, j) $ the greatest common divisor of $ i $ and $ j $ is equal to $ 1 $ . Each number should appear in exactly one of the pairs.
Print the resulting pairs or output that no solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \le l < r \le 10^{18} $ , $ r - l + 1 \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ (r - l) $ is odd).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If any solution exists, print "YES" in the first line. Each of the next $ \frac{r - l + 1}{2} $ lines should contain some pair of integers. GCD of numbers in each pair should be equal to $ 1 $ . All $ (r - l + 1) $ numbers should be pairwise distinct and should have values from $ l $ to $ r $ inclusive.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
If there exists no solution, print "NO".</div>
