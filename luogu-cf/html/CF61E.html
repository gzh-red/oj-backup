<h1>Enemy is weak</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
## 题目描述
罗马人再次进攻波斯。这一次他们比波斯人强大，但沙普尔有信心战胜他们。他充满信心地说:“狮子不怕百只羊。”
不过，沙普尔必须找到罗马军队的弱点才能战胜他们。所以他给了军队一个弱点数字。
在他看来，军队的弱点数字等于三元组i，j，k的数量。比如:i<j<k & a[i]>a[j]>a[k].其中a[x]是站在x位置的人的力量，罗马军队有一个特别的地方——军队中所有人都有着不同的力量。
请你帮沙普尔找出这个弱点数字。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
第一行一个n(3<=n<=10^6)，代表军人总数，第二行n个整数a[i] (1<=i<=n,1<=a[i]<=10^9)，代表军人的力量值。
### 输出格式
一行一个整数，代表罗马军队的弱点数字。
(在C++中，请不要用%lld输出长整型，建议使用cout，也可以用%l64d)。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Romans have attacked again. This time they are much more than the Persians but Shapur is ready to defeat them. He says: "A lion is never afraid of a hundred sheep".
Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.
In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets $ i,j,k $ such that $ i&lt;j&lt;k $ and $ a_{i}&gt;a_{j}&gt;a_{k} $ where $ a_{x} $ is the power of man standing at position $ x $ . The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.
Help Shapur find out how weak the Romans are.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single number $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=10^{6} $ ) — the number of men in Roman army. Next line contains $ n $ different positive integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=i<=n,1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — powers of men in the Roman army.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer number, the weakness of the Roman army.
Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use %I64d).</div>
