<h1>The Unbearable Lightness of Weights</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你 $n$ 个砝码，你知道这些砝码都有什么质量，但是你无法将质量和确切的砝码一一对应。
你的朋友知道每个砝码各是什么质量，你现在可以问她一个问题。你指定一个 $k$ 和一个 $w$，她会告诉你是否有 $k$ 个砝码质量总和为 $w$，（并且给你指出那 $k$ 个砝码）。现在问你，在这次提问之后你可以确定几个砝码的质量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a set of $ n $ weights. You know that their masses are $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ grams, but you don't know which of them has which mass. You can't distinguish the weights.
However, your friend does know the mass of each weight. You can ask your friend to give you exactly $ k $ weights with the total mass $ m $ (both parameters $ k $ and $ m $ are chosen by you), and your friend will point to any valid subset of weights, if it is possible.
You are allowed to make this query only once. Find the maximum possible number of weights you can reveal after this query.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of weights.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ ) — the masses of the weights.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum number of weights you can learn the masses for after making a single query.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example we can ask for a subset of two weights with total mass being equal to $ 4 $ , and the only option is to get $ \{2, 2\} $ .
Another way to obtain the same result is to ask for a subset of two weights with the total mass of $ 5 $ and get $ \{1, 4\} $ . It is easy to see that the two remaining weights have mass of $ 2 $ grams each.
In the second example we can ask for a subset of two weights with total mass being $ 8 $ , and the only answer is $ \{4, 4\} $ . We can prove it is not possible to learn masses for three weights in one query, but we won't put the proof here.</div>
