<h1>Track</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You already know that Valery's favorite sport is biathlon. Due to your help, he learned to shoot without missing, and his skills are unmatched at the shooting range. But now a smaller task is to be performed, he should learn to complete the path fastest.
The track's map is represented by a rectangle $ n×m $ in size divided into squares. Each square is marked with a lowercase Latin letter (which means the type of the plot), with the exception of the starting square (it is marked with a capital Latin letters $ S $ ) and the terminating square (it is marked with a capital Latin letter $ T $ ). The time of movement from one square to another is equal to $ 1 $ minute. The time of movement within the cell can be neglected. We can move from the cell only to side-adjacent ones, but it is forbidden to go beyond the map edges. Also the following restriction is imposed on the path: it is not allowed to visit more than $ k $ different types of squares (squares of one type can be visited an infinite number of times). Squares marked with $ S $ and $ T $ have no type, so they are not counted. But $ S $ must be visited exactly once — at the very beginning, and $ T $ must be visited exactly once — at the very end.
Your task is to find the path from the square $ S $ to the square $ T $ that takes minimum time. Among all shortest paths you should choose the lexicographically minimal one. When comparing paths you should lexicographically represent them as a sequence of characters, that is, of plot types.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=50,n·m>=2,1<=k<=4 $ ). Then $ n $ lines contain the map. Each line has the length of exactly $ m $ characters and consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters $ S $ and $ T $ . It is guaranteed that the map contains exactly one character $ S $ and exactly one character $ T $ .
Pretest 12 is one of the maximal tests for this problem.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is a path that satisfies the condition, print it as a sequence of letters — the plot types. Otherwise, print "-1" (without quotes). You shouldn't print the character $ S $ in the beginning and $ T $ in the end.
Note that this sequence may be empty. This case is present in pretests. You can just print nothing or print one "End of line"-character. Both will be accepted.</div>
