<h1>You Are Given a WASD-string...</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a string $ s $ — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:
- 'W' — move one cell up;
- 'S' — move one cell down;
- 'A' — move one cell left;
- 'D' — move one cell right.
Let $ Grid(s) $ be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands $ s $ . For example, if $ s = \text{DSAWWAW} $ then $ Grid(s) $ is the $ 4 \times 3 $ grid:
1. you can place the robot in the cell $ (3, 2) $ ;
2. the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to $ (3, 3) $ ;
3. the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to $ (4, 3) $ ;
4. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $ (4, 2) $ ;
5. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (3, 2) $ ;
6. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (2, 2) $ ;
7. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $ (2, 1) $ ;
8. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (1, 1) $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1202C/14db41d91dc6fffe218fcbada16fff9a7890d775.png)You have $ 4 $ extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insert at most one of these letters in any position of sequence $ s $ to minimize the area of $ Grid(s) $ .
What is the minimum area of $ Grid(s) $ you can achieve?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \le T \le 1000 $ ) — the number of queries.
Next $ T $ lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string $ s $ ( $ 1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ s_i \in \{\text{W}, \text{A}, \text{S}, \text{D}\} $ ) — the sequence of commands.
It's guaranteed that the total length of $ s $ over all queries doesn't exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ T $ integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of $ Grid(s) $ you can achieve.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query you have to get string $ \text{DSAWW}\underline{D}\text{AW} $ .
In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of $ Grid(s) $ .</div>
