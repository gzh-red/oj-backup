<h1>Maximum Balanced Circle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入k个数,构造一个最大(大小为n)的环，环上任意abs(a[(i+1)%n]-a[i])<=1。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ people in a row. The height of the $ i $ -th person is $ a_i $ . You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.
A balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than $ 1 $ . For example, let heights of chosen people be $ [a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \dots, a_{i_k}] $ , where $ k $ is the number of people you choose. Then the condition $ |a_{i_j} - a_{i_{j + 1}}| \le 1 $ should be satisfied for all $ j $ from $ 1 $ to $ k-1 $ and the condition $ |a_{i_1} - a_{i_k}| \le 1 $ should be also satisfied. $ |x| $ means the absolute value of $ x $ . It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.
Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of people.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the height of the $ i $ -th person.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of the output print $ k $ — the number of people in the maximum balanced circle.
In the second line print $ k $ integers $ res_1, res_2, \dots, res_k $ , where $ res_j $ is the height of the $ j $ -th person in the maximum balanced circle. The condition $ |res_{j} - res_{j + 1}| \le 1 $ should be satisfied for all $ j $ from $ 1 $ to $ k-1 $ and the condition $ |res_{1} - res_{k}| \le 1 $ should be also satisfied.</div>
