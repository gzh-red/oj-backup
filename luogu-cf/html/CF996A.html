<h1>Hit the Lottery</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个数 $n$,
令 $n = k_1 + k_2 * 5 + k_3 * 10 + k_4 * 20 + k_5 * 100, k \epsilon N^*$
最小化$Answer = \sum_{i = 1} ^ {5} k_i$
感谢@wsndy 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Allen has a LOT of money. He has $ n $ dollars in the bank. For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are $ 1 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 10 $ , $ 20 $ , $ 100 $ . What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a $ 100 $ dollar bill, a $ 20 $ dollar bill, and a $ 5 $ dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive $ 125 $ dollars in one or two bills.
In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two $ 20 $ dollar bills and three $ 1 $ dollar bills.
In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw $ 100000000 $ (ten million!) $ 100 $ dollar bills.</div>
