<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目大意：
给定一个长度为$n$的字符串和$k$，问这个字符串包含字母表前$k$个大写字母并且数量相同的子序列最长是多少
### 输入格式：

第二行一个长度为$n$的字符串
### 输出格式：
一个整数，表示最小长度

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , which consists only of the first $ k $ letters of the Latin alphabet. All letters in string $ s $ are uppercase.
A subsequence of string $ s $ is a string that can be derived from $ s $ by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, "ADE" and "BD" are subsequences of "ABCDE", but "DEA" is not.
A subsequence of $ s $ called good if the number of occurences of each of the first $ k $ letters of the alphabet is the same.
Find the length of the longest good subsequence of $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integers $ n $ ( $ 1\le n \le 10^5 $ ) and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le 26 $ ).
The second line of the input contains the string $ s $ of length $ n $ . String $ s $ only contains uppercase letters from 'A' to the $ k $ -th letter of Latin alphabet.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only integer — the length of the longest good subsequence of string $ s $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>9 3
ACAABCCAB
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9 4
ABCABCABC
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>0</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, "ACBCAB" ("ACAABCCAB") is one of the subsequences that has the same frequency of 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Subsequence "CAB" also has the same frequency of these letters, but doesn't have the maximum possible length.
In the second example, none of the subsequences can have 'D', hence the answer is $ 0 $ .</div>
