<h1>The Untended Antiquity</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个n∗m(0<=n,m<=2500)的空地,支持三种操作:
- 在以(x1,y1)为左上角,(x2,y2)为右下角的矩形外侧建一堵墙..(不会盖到空地的最外围)
- 拆除以(x1,y1)为左上角,(x2,y2)为右下角的矩形外侧的墙..(墙保证存在)
- 查询(x1,y1)格与(x2,y2)格是否连通= =
其中,墙围保证没有公共点..</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Adieu l'ami.
Koyomi is helping Oshino, an acquaintance of his, to take care of an open space around the abandoned Eikou Cram School building, Oshino's makeshift residence.
The space is represented by a rectangular grid of $ n×m $ cells, arranged into $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. The $ c $ -th cell in the $ r $ -th row is denoted by $ (r,c) $ .
Oshino places and removes barriers around rectangular areas of cells. Specifically, an action denoted by " $ 1\ r_{1}\ c_{1}\ r_{2}\ c_{2} $ " means Oshino's placing barriers around a rectangle with two corners being $ (r_{1},c_{1}) $ and $ (r_{2},c_{2}) $ and sides parallel to squares sides. Similarly, " $ 2\ r_{1}\ c_{1}\ r_{2}\ c_{2} $ " means Oshino's removing barriers around the rectangle. Oshino ensures that no barriers staying on the ground share any common points, nor do they intersect with boundaries of the $ n×m $ area.
Sometimes Koyomi tries to walk from one cell to another carefully without striding over barriers, in order to avoid damaging various items on the ground. " $ 3\ r_{1}\ c_{1}\ r_{2}\ c_{2} $ " means that Koyomi tries to walk from $ (r_{1},c_{1}) $ to $ (r_{2},c_{2}) $ without crossing barriers.
And you're here to tell Koyomi the feasibility of each of his attempts.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=2500 $ , $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the total number of Oshino and Koyomi's actions, respectively.
The following $ q $ lines each describes an action, containing five space-separated integers $ t $ , $ r_{1} $ , $ c_{1} $ , $ r_{2} $ , $ c_{2} $ ( $ 1<=t<=3 $ , $ 1<=r_{1},r_{2}<=n $ , $ 1<=c_{1},c_{2}<=m $ ) — the type and two coordinates of an action. Additionally, the following holds depending on the value of $ t $ :
- If $ t=1 $ : $ 2<=r_{1}<=r_{2}<=n-1 $ , $ 2<=c_{1}<=c_{2}<=m-1 $ ;
- If $ t=2 $ : $ 2<=r_{1}<=r_{2}<=n-1 $ , $ 2<=c_{1}<=c_{2}<=m-1 $ , the specified group of barriers exist on the ground before the removal.
- If $ t=3 $ : no extra restrictions.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each of Koyomi's attempts (actions with $ t=3 $ ), output one line — containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's feasible, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.</div>
