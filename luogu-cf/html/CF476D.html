<h1>Dreamoon and Sets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入$n,k$，输出$n$个四元组。
满足以下条件
- 对于任意一个四元组，其中任意两个数的最大公约数是$k$
- 每个数在四元组内只出现一次
要求$n$个四元组内最大的数最小。
第一行输出最大的数，下面$n$行输出四元组。
$1\le n\le 10000$
$1\le k\le 100$
输出四元组时，顺序和整数的顺序都不重要，你可以任意输出。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dreamoon likes to play with sets, integers and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476D/9ecd8274ff74f04a3c110790f7ff835d44a6c25f.png). ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476D/8ea8f21b5c14716258752d62a549551fbdbf04b7.png) is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both $ a $ and $ b $ .
Let $ S $ be a set of exactly four distinct integers greater than $ 0 $ . Define $ S $ to be of rank $ k $ if and only if for all pairs of distinct elements $ s_{i} $ , $ s_{j} $ from $ S $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476D/dd0b12b681c32c8696e149f43e49ae7211e0b09c.png).
Given $ k $ and $ n $ , Dreamoon wants to make up $ n $ sets of rank $ k $ using integers from $ 1 $ to $ m $ such that no integer is used in two different sets (of course you can leave some integers without use). Calculate the minimum $ m $ that makes it possible and print one possible solution.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line of the input contains two space separated integers $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000,1<=k<=100 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line print a single integer — the minimal possible $ m $ .
On each of the next $ n $ lines print four space separated integers representing the $ i $ -th set.
Neither the order of the sets nor the order of integers within a set is important. If there are multiple possible solutions with minimal $ m $ , print any one of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first example it's easy to see that set $ {1,2,3,4} $ isn't a valid set of rank 1 since ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF476D/b50d3b1ab922da09703e2c03eee592786ae2b8c7.png).</div>
