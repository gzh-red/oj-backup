<h1>African Crossword</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入n,m，有一个n * m的字符阵，对于每行或每列，删去相同的字符，最后按顺序输出剩下的字符。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>An African crossword is a rectangular table $ n×m $ in size. Each cell of the table contains exactly one letter. This table (it is also referred to as grid) contains some encrypted word that needs to be decoded.
To solve the crossword you should cross out all repeated letters in rows and columns. In other words, a letter should only be crossed out if and only if the corresponding column or row contains at least one more letter that is exactly the same. Besides, all such letters are crossed out simultaneously.
When all repeated letters have been crossed out, we should write the remaining letters in a string. The letters that occupy a higher position follow before the letters that occupy a lower position. If the letters are located in one row, then the letter to the left goes first. The resulting word is the answer to the problem.
You are suggested to solve an African crossword and print the word encrypted there.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
