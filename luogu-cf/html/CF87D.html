<h1>Beautiful Road</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A long time ago in some country in Asia were civil wars.
Each of $ n $ cities wanted to seize power. That's why sometimes one city gathered an army and sent it to campaign against another city.
Road making was difficult, so the country had few roads, exactly $ n-1 $ . Also you could reach any city from any other city going on those roads.
Even during the war the Oriental people remain spiritually rich and appreciate the beauty of nature. And to keep the memory of this great crusade for the centuries to come, they planted one beautiful tree by the road on which the army spent most time. The Oriental people love nature, that's why if there were several such roads, then one tree was planted by each of them.
Recently, when the records of the war were found, it became clear that each city attacked each other one exactly once. There were exactly $ n(n-1) $ attacks in total. Everyone has been wondering what road after those wars became the most beautiful, that is, by which road they planted the largest number of beautiful trees.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ), which represents the number of cities. Next $ n-1 $ lines contain three integers each: the numbers of cities $ a_{i},b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ), connected by the $ i $ -th road and the number of days $ d_{i} $ the army spends to go on it ( $ 1<=d_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). The lengths of several roads may coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print on the first line two integers — the number of beautiful trees on the most beautiful road and the number of the most beautiful roads. Print on the second line the list of the most beautiful roads in the sorted order by the numbers' increasing. The roads are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ in the order in which they are given in the input data.
Please, do not use %lld specificator to write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cout stream (also you may use the %I64d specificator).</div>
