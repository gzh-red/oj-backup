<h1>Plus from Picture</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一张大小为 $w \times h$、由 `*` 和 `.` 组成的地图，试求地图中是否**有且仅有**一个满足如下条件的 `+` 形图形：
- 中心点为 `*`
- 上下左右四个方向都有一个或多个连续的 `*`
- 除以上各点之外，整张地图均为 `.`</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a given picture with size $ w \times h $ . Determine if the given picture has a single "+" shape or not. A "+" shape is described below:
- A "+" shape has one center nonempty cell.
- There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the center. In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.
- All other cells are empty.
Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ h $ and $ w $ ( $ 1 \le h $ , $ w \le 500 $ ) — the height and width of the picture.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ h $ lines contains string $ s_{i} $ of length $ w $ consisting "." and "\*" where "." denotes the empty space and "\*" denotes the non-empty space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the given picture satisfies all conditions, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".
You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>
