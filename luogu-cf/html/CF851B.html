<h1>Arpa and an exam about geometry</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
Arpa正在参加一场几何学考试。这是这场考试的最后一题。
给你三个点。让你找一个点和一个角度使得按这个点旋转这个角度后，a的新位置与b的原位置重合，b的新位置与c的原位置重合。
Arpa怀疑这个问题是否有解（如果存在一个点和一个角度满足条件）。请帮助Arpa确定这个问题是否有解决方案。
输入格式：
单独一行包含六个整数$a_{x},a_{y},b_{x},b_{y},c_{x},c_{y}$ 。保证给出的点是不同的。
输出格式：
如果这个问题有解决方案，输出 "Yes"，否则，输出 "No" 。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Arpa is taking a geometry exam. Here is the last problem of the exam.
You are given three points $ a,b,c $ .
Find a point and an angle such that if we rotate the page around the point by the angle, the new position of $ a $ is the same as the old position of $ b $ , and the new position of $ b $ is the same as the old position of $ c $ .
Arpa is doubting if the problem has a solution or not (i.e. if there exists a point and an angle satisfying the condition). Help Arpa determine if the question has a solution or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains six integers $ a_{x},a_{y},b_{x},b_{y},c_{x},c_{y} $ ( $ |a_{x}|,|a_{y}|,|b_{x}|,|b_{y}|,|c_{x}|,|c_{y}|<=10^{9} $ ). It's guaranteed that the points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Yes" if the problem has a solution, "No" otherwise.
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0 1 1 1 1 0
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Yes
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1 1 0 0 1000 1000
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>No
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test, rotate the page around $ (0.5,0.5) $ by ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF851B/fe3c8011bb9ee15abb5ac0ee9f2f980eef59656c.png).
In the second sample test, you can't find any solution.</div>
