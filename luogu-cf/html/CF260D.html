<h1>Black and White Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>董事会有一个绘制的树形图，由n个节点组成。让我们提醒您，如果一个无向图是连通的，并且不包含任何循环，它就称为树。图中的每个节点都被涂成黑色或白色，这样就不会有两个颜色相同的节点，由一个边缘连接起来。每条边都包含它写成非负整数的值.一个坏男孩Vasya走到板前，在每个节点v附近写下了编号s[v]。这是与该节点相关的所有边的值之和。然后Vasya从板上移除边缘和它们的值。您的任务是通过节点颜色和数字s[v]恢复原始树。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The board has got a painted tree graph, consisting of $ n $ nodes. Let us remind you that a non-directed graph is called a tree if it is connected and doesn't contain any cycles.
Each node of the graph is painted black or white in such a manner that there aren't two nodes of the same color, connected by an edge. Each edge contains its value written on it as a non-negative integer.
A bad boy Vasya came up to the board and wrote number $ s_{v} $ near each node $ v $ — the sum of values of all edges that are incident to this node. Then Vasya removed the edges and their values from the board.
Your task is to restore the original tree by the node colors and numbers $ s_{v} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of nodes in the tree. Next $ n $ lines contain pairs of space-separated integers $ c_{i} $ , $ s_{i} $ ( $ 0<=c_{i}<=1 $ , $ 0<=s_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ c_{i} $ stands for the color of the $ i $ -th vertex (0 is for white, 1 is for black), and $ s_{i} $ represents the sum of values of the edges that are incident to the $ i $ -th vertex of the tree that is painted on the board.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the description of $ n-1 $ edges of the tree graph. Each description is a group of three integers $ v_{i} $ , $ u_{i} $ , $ w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i},u_{i}<=n $ , $ v_{i}≠u_{i} $ , $ 0<=w_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ v_{i} $ and $ u_{i} $ — are the numbers of the nodes that are connected by the $ i $ -th edge, and $ w_{i} $ is its value. Note that the following condition must fulfill $ c_{vi}≠c_{ui} $ .
It is guaranteed that for any input data there exists at least one graph that meets these data. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. You are allowed to print the edges in any order. As you print the numbers, separate them with spaces.</div>
