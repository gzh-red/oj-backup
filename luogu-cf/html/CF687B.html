<h1>Remainders Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个数n和k， n为给定的数的个数， k为所求数。
输入ｎ个数分别为C1, C2, ..., Cn;
问 ：　lcm(C1, C2, ..., Cn) % k是否等于零，　是的话输出Yes，不是则输出No。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today Pari and Arya are playing a game called Remainders.
Pari chooses two positive integer $ x $ and $ k $ , and tells Arya $ k $ but not $ x $ . Arya have to find the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/74cc0e497602c391113efb814a12e06ebc180bd8.png). There are $ n $ ancient numbers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ and Pari has to tell Arya ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/d6826eab3568be14654e0e163000c670f1c64e14.png) if Arya wants. Given $ k $ and the ancient values, tell us if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of $ x $ or not. Formally, is it true that Arya can understand the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/74cc0e497602c391113efb814a12e06ebc180bd8.png) for any positive integer $ x $ ?
Note, that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/cb1d84ad58154eb7ea26b65d1ae0039570db9bb6.png) means the remainder of $ x $ after dividing it by $ y $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,\ k<=1000000 $ ) — the number of ancient integers and value $ k $ that is chosen by Pari.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=1000000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of $ x $ , or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 5
2 3 5 12
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Yes
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 7
2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>No
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Arya can understand ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/b93dce9b9ef400fa12cce1ab52784e3449739731.png) because $ 5 $ is one of the ancient numbers.
In the second sample, Arya can't be sure what ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF687B/34daaca50b46751e5d9e1271dc07f186fd9fd248.png) is. For example $ 1 $ and $ 7 $ have the same remainders after dividing by $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ , but they differ in remainders after dividing by $ 7 $ .</div>
