<h1>Combining Slimes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个长度为$1×n$的网格，每次从最右侧往里推入一个数字$1$或$2$（数字会一直跑到最左边的空格子里），加入$1$的概率为$p$，$2$的概率为$1-p$。如果新加入的数与其左边的那个数相同，都等于$x$，则将二者合并变成$x+1$。然后继续判断是否能与左边合并（跟$2048$差不多）。问你当最后格子满时，整个网格中所有数的和的期望值。
$n≤10^9$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your friend recently gave you some slimes for your birthday. You have a very large amount of slimes with value $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , and you decide to invent a game using these slimes.
You initialize a row with $ n $ empty spaces. You also choose a number $ p $ to be used in the game. Then, you will perform the following steps while the last space is empty.
1. With probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF618G/bb27be5e0466e1c87e83bd592f5ebec1f3679c2d.png), you will choose a slime with value $ 1 $ , and with probability ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF618G/c1a5ec97692fc955705c1d6dbdc8e7857800ac46.png), you will choose a slime with value $ 2 $ . You place the chosen slime on the last space of the board.
2. You will push the slime to the left as far as possible. If it encounters another slime, and they have the same value $ v $ , you will merge the slimes together to create a single slime with value $ v+1 $ . This continues on until the slime reaches the end of the board, or encounters a slime with a different value than itself.
You have played the game a few times, but have gotten bored of it. You are now wondering, what is the expected sum of all values of the slimes on the board after you finish the game.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input will contain two integers $ n,p $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9},1<=p&lt;10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the expected sum of all slimes on the board after the game finishes. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-4} $ .
Namely, let's assume that your answer is $ a $ and the answer of the jury is $ b $ . The checker program will consider your answer correct, if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF618G/52c84cb27b50fce8b08f35fa39c1f083ebd1a014.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, we have a board with two squares, and there is a $ 0.5 $ probability of a 1 appearing and a $ 0.5 $ probability of a 2 appearing.
Our final board states can be 1 2 with probability $ 0.25 $ , 2 1 with probability $ 0.375 $ , 3 2 with probability $ 0.1875 $ , 3 1 with probability $ 0.1875 $ . The expected value is thus $ (1+2)·0.25+(2+1)·0.375+(3+2)·0.1875+(3+1)·0.1875=3.5625 $ .</div>
