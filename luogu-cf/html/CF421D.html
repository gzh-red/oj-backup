<h1>Bug in Code</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
XX公司的代码出问题了！！老板十分生气，为了有个说法，他决定选出两个背黑锅的人。
现在有n个人，每个人都会选出两个背黑锅的人，老板想要让决定背黑锅的两个人的支持数（就是有几个人想让这个人背黑锅）之和大于等于P。请问有多少种选择方案（顺序无关）
输入格式
第一行两个数n和p，后n行每行两个数xi，yi，表示想让xi和yi背锅。
输出格式
一行，一个数，表示共有多少种方案数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently a serious bug has been found in the FOS code. The head of the F company wants to find the culprit and punish him. For that, he set up an organizational meeting, the issue is: who's bugged the code? Each of the $ n $ coders on the meeting said: 'I know for sure that either $ x $ or $ y $ did it!'
The head of the company decided to choose two suspects and invite them to his office. Naturally, he should consider the coders' opinions. That's why the head wants to make such a choice that at least $ p $ of $ n $ coders agreed with it. A coder agrees with the choice of two suspects if at least one of the two people that he named at the meeting was chosen as a suspect. In how many ways can the head of F choose two suspects?
Note that even if some coder was chosen as a suspect, he can agree with the head's choice if he named the other chosen coder at the meeting.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ and $ p $ $ (3<=n<=3·10^{5}; 0<=p<=n) $ — the number of coders in the F company and the minimum number of agreed people.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ $ (1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=n) $ — the numbers of coders named by the $ i $ -th coder. It is guaranteed that $ x_{i}≠i, y_{i}≠i, x_{i}≠y_{i} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of possible two-suspect sets. Note that the order of the suspects doesn't matter, that is, sets $ (1,2) $ and $ (2,1) $ are considered identical.</div>
