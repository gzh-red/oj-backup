<h1>s-palindrome</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div> 给出一个字符串，判断这个字符串中间是否是对称的。
是输出“TAK”，不是输出“NIE”。
@[chen_zhe](/space/show?uid=8457) @[yjjr](/space/show?uid=5088)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.
