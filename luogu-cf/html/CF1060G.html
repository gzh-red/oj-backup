<h1>Balls and Pockets</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a strip with an infinite number of cells. Cells are numbered starting with $ 0 $ . Initially the cell $ i $ contains a ball with the number $ i $ .
There are $ n $ pockets located at cells $ a_1, \ldots, a_n $ . Each cell contains at most one pocket.
Filtering is the following sequence of operations:
- All pockets at cells $ a_1, \ldots, a_n $ open simultaneously, which makes balls currently located at those cells disappear. After the balls disappear, the pockets close again.
- For each cell $ i $ from $ 0 $ to $ \infty $ , if the cell $ i $ contains a ball, we move that ball to the free cell $ j $ with the lowest number. If there is no free cell $ j < i $ , the ball stays at the cell $ i $ .
Note that after each filtering operation each cell will still contain exactly one ball.
For example, let the cells $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ and $ 4 $ contain pockets. The initial configuration of balls is shown below (underscores display the cells with pockets):
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... After opening and closing the pockets, balls 1, 3 and 4 disappear:
0 2 5 6 7 8 9 ... After moving all the balls to the left, the configuration looks like this:
0 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ... Another filtering repetition results in the following:
0 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... You have to answer $ m $ questions. The $ i $ -th of these questions is "what is the number of the ball located at the cell $ x_i $ after $ k_i $ repetitions of the filtering operation?"</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ — the number of pockets and questions respectively ( $ 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 $ ).
The following line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, \ldots, a_n $ — the numbers of cells containing pockets ( $ 0 \leq a_1 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9 $ ).
The following $ m $ lines describe questions. The $ i $ -th of these lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ k_i $ ( $ 0 \leq x_i, k_i \leq 10^9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ numbers — answers to the questions, in the same order as given in the input.</div>
