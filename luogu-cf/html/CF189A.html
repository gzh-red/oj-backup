<h1>Cut Ribbon</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一长度为n的缎带，要求将其剪成若干长度为a,b,c的缎带，且缎带数量尽可能多。
输入格式：
输入仅一行，四个正整数n,a,b,c(n,a,b,c≤4000)。
输出格式：
输出仅一行，即缎带数量的最大值。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is $ n $ . He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:
- After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length $ a $ , $ b $ or $ c $ .
- After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum.
Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ $ (1<=n,a,b,c<=4000) $ — the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ can coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 5 3 2

</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.
In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.</div>
