<h1>Appleman and Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一棵树
点之间存在父子关系，除根（1号点）之外有的点是黑色的有的点是白色的
把树分成若干个联通块使得每个联通块有且仅有一个黑点，问有多少种分法
第一行n，表示点的数量 第二行n-1个数字，第i个数字表示i+1号节点的父亲 第三行n个数字，表示点的颜色
一个数字，答案对1e9+7取模</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Appleman has a tree with $ n $ vertices. Some of the vertices (at least one) are colored black and other vertices are colored white.
Consider a set consisting of $ k $ $ (0<=k<n) $ edges of Appleman's tree. If Appleman deletes these edges from the tree, then it will split into $ (k+1) $ parts. Note, that each part will be a tree with colored vertices.

Now Appleman wonders, what is the number of sets splitting the tree in such a way that each resulting part will have exactly one black vertex? Find this number modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of tree vertices.

The second line contains the description of the tree: $ n-1 $ integers $ p_{0},p_{1},...,p_{n-2} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=i $ ). Where $ p_{i} $ means that there is an edge connecting vertex $ (i+1) $ of the tree and vertex $ p_{i} $ . Consider tree vertices are numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ .

The third line contains the description of the colors of the vertices: $ n $ integers $ x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n-1} $ ( $ x_{i} $ is either $ 0 $ or $ 1 $ ). If $ x_{i} $ is equal to $ 1 $ , vertex $ i $ is colored black. Otherwise, vertex $ i $ is colored white.</div>
    <h3>输出格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>Output a single integer — the number of ways to split the tree modulo $ 1000000007 $ ( $ 10^{9}+7 $ ).</div>
