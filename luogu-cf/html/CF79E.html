<h1>Security System</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fox Ciel safely returned to her castle, but there was something wrong with the security system of the castle: sensors attached in the castle were covering her.
Ciel is at point $ (1,1) $ of the castle now, and wants to move to point $ (n,n) $ , which is the position of her room. By one step, Ciel can move from point $ (x,y) $ to either $ (x+1,y) $ (rightward) or $ (x,y+1) $ (upward).
In her castle, $ c^{2} $ sensors are set at points $ (a+i,b+j) $ (for every integer $ i $ and $ j $ such that: $ 0<=i&lt;c,0<=j&lt;c $ ).
Each sensor has a count value and decreases its count value every time Ciel moves. Initially, the count value of each sensor is $ t $ . Every time Ciel moves to point $ (x,y) $ , the count value of a sensor at point $ (u,v) $ decreases by ( $ |u-x|+|v-y| $ ). When the count value of some sensor becomes strictly less than $ 0 $ , the sensor will catch Ciel as a suspicious individual!
Determine whether Ciel can move from $ (1,1) $ to $ (n,n) $ without being caught by a sensor, and if it is possible, output her steps. Assume that Ciel can move to every point even if there is a censor on the point.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line there are five integers $ n,t,a,b,c $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5}, $ $ 0<=t<=10^{14}, $ $ 1<=a<=n-c+1, $ $ 1<=b<=n-c+1, $ $ 1<=c<=n $ ).
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin stream (also you may use the %I64d specificator).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Ciel's objective is possible, output in first line $ 2n-2 $ characters that represent her feasible steps, where $ i $ -th character is R if $ i $ -th step is moving rightward, or U if moving upward. If there are several solution, output lexicographically first one. Character R is lexicographically earlier than the character U.
If her objective is impossible, output Impossible.</div>
