<h1>Vika and Squares</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vika has $ n $ jars with paints of distinct colors. All the jars are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and the $ i $ -th jar contains $ a_{i} $ liters of paint of color $ i $ .
Vika also has an infinitely long rectangular piece of paper of width $ 1 $ , consisting of squares of size $ 1×1 $ . Squares are numbered $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ and so on. Vika decided that she will start painting squares one by one from left to right, starting from the square number $ 1 $ and some arbitrary color. If the square was painted in color $ x $ , then the next square will be painted in color $ x+1 $ . In case of $ x=n $ , next square is painted in color $ 1 $ . If there is no more paint of the color Vika wants to use now, then she stops.
Square is always painted in only one color, and it takes exactly $ 1 $ liter of paint. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of squares that might be painted, if Vika chooses right color to paint the first square.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of jars with colors Vika has.
The second line of the input contains a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is equal to the number of liters of paint in the $ i $ -th jar, i.e. the number of liters of color $ i $ that Vika has.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the output should contain a single integer — the maximum number of squares that Vika can paint if she follows the rules described above.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the best strategy is to start painting using color $ 4 $ . Then the squares will be painted in the following colors (from left to right): 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
In the second sample Vika can start to paint using any color.
In the third sample Vika should start painting using color number $ 5 $ .</div>
