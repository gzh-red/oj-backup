<h1>A and B and Chess</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
A和B正在准备参加编程比赛。
为了锻炼他们的逻辑思维能力从而更好地解决问题，A和B决定来下棋。在游戏期间，A突然想要知道哪位玩家占得了优势。
对于每个棋子我们知道它们的权势值：
皇后的值是9；
车的值是5；
象（相）的值是3；
骑士的值也是3；
卒（兵）的值是1；
国王的值不考虑在优势评估中.
一个玩家的优势值是他在棋盘上所有棋子权势值的总和。
因为A不喜欢算数，所以他请求你告诉他哪位玩家的占有优势？（即优势值更大）
输入格式
输入一共八行，八列，描述这个棋盘。
白方的棋子如要表示均用大写字母，黑方则用的是小写字母。
白方棋子规定如下：皇后用Q表示，车用R表示，象用B表示，骑士用N表示，卒用P表示，国王用K表示。
黑方棋子则相反，用小写字母：q,r,b,n,p,k。
一个空的棋盘格子用"."（一个点）表示
无需考虑棋盘上的情况能否在真实的游戏中实现，只需计算出优势总值再比较即可。
输出格式
如果白方的优势总值更大，则输出"White",如果黑方的优势总值更大，则输出"Black"。如果总值相等，那么请输出"Draw"。
说明
对于样例一，白方总值为9，黑方总值为5，所以输出"White"。
对于样例二，两方总值均为39，输出"Draw"。
对于样例三，白方总值为9，黑方总值为16，输出"Black"。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests.
To train their logical thinking and solve problems better, A and B decided to play chess. During the game A wondered whose position is now stronger.
For each chess piece we know its weight:
- the queen's weight is 9,
- the rook's weight is 5,
- the bishop's weight is 3,
- the knight's weight is 3,
- the pawn's weight is 1,
- the king's weight isn't considered in evaluating position.
The player's weight equals to the sum of weights of all his pieces on the board.
As A doesn't like counting, he asked you to help him determine which player has the larger position weight.</div>
