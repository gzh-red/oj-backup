<h1>Alex and a TV Show</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>维护n个初始为空的可重集，支持以下操作：
1 x v:令集合x等于{v}
2 x y z:令集合x等于集合y与z的并
3 x y z:令集合x等于集合y与z的积，$A*B=\{gcd(a,b)|a\in A,b\in B\}$
4 x v:询问v在集合x中出现次数模2的结果</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alex decided to try his luck in TV shows. He once went to the quiz named "What's That Word?!". After perfectly answering the questions "How is a pseudonym commonly referred to in the Internet?" ("Um... a nick?"), "After which famous inventor we name the unit of the magnetic field strength?" ("Um... Nikola Tesla?") and "Which rock band performs "How You Remind Me"?" ("Um... Nickelback?"), he decided to apply to a little bit more difficult TV show: "What's in This Multiset?!".
The rules of this TV show are as follows: there are $ n $ multisets numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Each of them is initially empty. Then, $ q $ events happen; each of them is in one of the four possible types:
- 1 x v — set the $ x $ -th multiset to a singleton $ \{v\} $ .
- 2 x y z — set the $ x $ -th multiset to a union of the $ y $ -th and the $ z $ -th multiset. For example: $ \{1, 3\}\cup\{1, 4, 4\}=\{1, 1, 3, 4, 4\} $ .
- 3 x y z — set the $ x $ -th multiset to a product of the $ y $ -th and the $ z $ -th multiset. The product $ A \times B $ of two multisets $ A $ , $ B $ is defined as $ \{ \gcd(a, b)\, \mid\, a \in A,\, b \in B \} $ , where $ \gcd(p, q) $ is the greatest common divisor of $ p $ and $ q $ . For example: $ \{2, 2, 3\} \times \{1, 4, 6\}=\{1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3\} $ .
- 4 x v — the participant is asked how many times number $ v $ occurs in the $ x $ -th multiset. As the quiz turned out to be too hard in the past, participants should now give the answers modulo $ 2 $ only.
Note, that $ x $ , $ y $ and $ z $ described above are not necessarily different. In events of types $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ , the sum or the product is computed first, and then the assignment is performed.
Alex is confused by the complicated rules of the show. Can you help him answer the requests of the $ 4 $ -th type?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ , $ 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 $ ) — the number of multisets and the number of events.
Each of the following $ q $ lines describes next event in the format given in statement. It's guaranteed that $ 1 \leq x,y,z \leq n $ and $ 1 \leq v \leq 7000 $ always holds.
It's guaranteed that there will be at least one event of the $ 4 $ -th type.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a string which consists of digits $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ only, and has length equal to the number of events of the $ 4 $ -th type. The $ i $ -th digit of the string should be equal to the answer for the $ i $ -th query of the $ 4 $ -th type.</div>
