<h1>Good String</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a string $ s $ of length $ n $ consisting of only characters > and <. You may do some operations with this string, for each operation you have to choose some character that still remains in the string. If you choose a character >, the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character <, the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).
For example, if we choose character > in string > > < >, the string will become to > > >. And if we choose character < in string > <, the string will become to <.
The string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings >, > > are good.
Before applying the operations, you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to $ n - 1 $ , but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $ s $ so that it becomes good.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) – the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two lines.
The first line of $ i $ -th test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) – the length of string $ s $ .
The second line of $ i $ -th test case contains string $ s $ , consisting of only characters > and <.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print one line.
For $ i $ -th test case print the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $ s $ so that it becomes good.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case we can delete any character in string <>.
In the second test case we don't need to delete any characters. The string > < < is good, because we can perform the following sequence of operations: > < < $ \rightarrow $ < < $ \rightarrow $ <.</div>
