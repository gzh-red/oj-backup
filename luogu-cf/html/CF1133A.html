<h1>Middle of the Contest</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入两个时间，需要你输出这两个时间的中间时刻
注意：题目保证这两个时间在同一天，且第一个时间会早于第二个时间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at $ h_1:m_1 $ and ends at $ h_2:m_2 $ . It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. $ m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2 $ , where $ x \% y $ is $ x $ modulo $ y $ ). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.
Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from $ 10:00 $ to $ 11:00 $ then the answer is $ 10:30 $ , if the contest lasts from $ 11:10 $ to $ 11:12 $ then the answer is $ 11:11 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ h_1 $ and $ m_1 $ in the format hh:mm.
The second line of the input contains two integers $ h_2 $ and $ m_2 $ in the same format (hh:mm).
It is guaranteed that $ 0 \le h_1, h_2 \le 23 $ and $ 0 \le m_1, m_2 \le 59 $ .
It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. $ m_1 \% 2 = m_2 \% 2 $ , where $ x \% y $ is $ x $ modulo $ y $ ). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two integers $ h_3 $ and $ m_3 $ ( $ 0 \le h_3 \le 23, 0 \le m_3 \le 59 $ ) corresponding to the midpoint of the contest in the format hh:mm. Print each number as exactly two digits (prepend a number with leading zero if needed), separate them with ':'.</div>
