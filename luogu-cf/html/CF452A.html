<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
你正在解决IPSC2014中的填字游戏中的问题K。你解决了所有线索，除了一个：Eevee将会进化成谁？你不是非常喜欢口袋妖怪，但是快速的谷歌搜索帮助你发现：Eevee能够进化成八种不同的口袋妖怪：Vaporeon，Jolteon，Flareon，Espeon，Umbreon，Leafeon，Glaceon和Sylveon。
你知道填字游戏中单词的长度，并且你已经知道了一些字母。填字游戏的设计者确保答案是唯一的，所以你可以假设Eevee进化成了8种口袋妖怪的中一个，然后去比较是否符合单词的长度和给出的字母。你的任务是去找到Eevee进化成的口袋妖怪

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are solving the crossword problem K from IPSC 2014. You solved all the clues except for one: who does Eevee evolve into? You are not very into pokemons, but quick googling helped you find out, that Eevee can evolve into eight different pokemons: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon.
You know the length of the word in the crossword, and you already know some letters. Designers of the crossword made sure that the answer is unambiguous, so you can assume that exactly one pokemon out of the 8 that Eevee evolves into fits the length and the letters given. Your task is to find it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 6<=n<=8 $ ) – the length of the string.
Next line contains a string consisting of $ n $ characters, each of which is either a lower case english letter (indicating a known letter) or a dot character (indicating an empty cell in the crossword).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a name of the pokemon that Eevee can evolve into that matches the pattern in the input. Use lower case letters only to print the name (in particular, do not capitalize the first letter).</div>
