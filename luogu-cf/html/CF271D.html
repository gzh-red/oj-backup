<h1>Good Substrings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在$26$个英文字母中有一些字母是“不好的”。若一个字符串中包含不超过$k$个不好的字母，则这个字符串是“好的”。
给你一个字符串$s$（$|s|\le 1500$）、$26$个字母好坏情况和$k$，求出$s$的所有子串中，**本质不同**的好的子串的数量。
两个子串被称为本质不同，当且仅当它们**内容不同**
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got string $ s $ , consisting of small English letters. Some of the English letters are good, the rest are bad.
A substring $ s[l...r] $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=|s| $ ) of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...s_{|s|} $ (where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) is string $ s_{l}s_{l+1}...s_{r} $ .
The substring $ s[l...r] $ is good, if among the letters $ s_{l},s_{l+1},...,s_{r} $ there are at most $ k $ bad ones (look at the sample's explanation to understand it more clear).
Your task is to find the number of distinct good substrings of the given string $ s $ . Two substrings $ s[x...y] $ and $ s[p...q] $ are considered distinct if their content is different, i.e. $ s[x...y]≠s[p...q] $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input is the non-empty string $ s $ , consisting of small English letters, the string's length is at most $ 1500 $ characters.
The second line of the input is the string of characters "0" and "1", the length is exactly 26 characters. If the $ i $ -th character of this string equals "1", then the $ i $ -th English letter is good, otherwise it's bad. That is, the first character of this string corresponds to letter "a", the second one corresponds to letter "b" and so on.
The third line of the input consists a single integer $ k $ ( $ 0<=k<=|s| $ ) — the maximum acceptable number of bad characters in a good substring.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of distinct good substrings of string $ s $ .</div>
