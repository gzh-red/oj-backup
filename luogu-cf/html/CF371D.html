<h1>Vessels</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a system of $ n $ vessels arranged one above the other as shown in the figure below. Assume that the vessels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ , in the order from the highest to the lowest, the volume of the $ i $ -th vessel is $ a_{i} $ liters.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF371D/f198564e53bb2ea5c99e17b823930a432879118f.png)Initially, all the vessels are empty. In some vessels water is poured. All the water that overflows from the $ i $ -th vessel goes to the $ (i+1) $ -th one. The liquid that overflows from the $ n $ -th vessel spills on the floor.
Your task is to simulate pouring water into the vessels. To do this, you will need to handle two types of queries:
1. Add $ x_{i} $ liters of water to the $ p_{i} $ -th vessel;
2. Print the number of liters of water in the $ k_{i} $ -th vessel.
When you reply to the second request you can assume that all the water poured up to this point, has already overflown between the vessels.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ — the number of vessels ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ). The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ — the vessels' capacities ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). The vessels' capacities do not necessarily increase from the top vessels to the bottom ones (see the second sample). The third line contains integer $ m $ — the number of queries ( $ 1<=m<=2·10^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ m $ lines contains the description of one query. The query of the first type is represented as " $ 1 p_{i} x_{i} $ ", the query of the second type is represented as " $ 2 k_{i} $ " ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ , $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=k_{i}<=n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query, print on a single line the number of liters of water in the corresponding vessel.</div>
