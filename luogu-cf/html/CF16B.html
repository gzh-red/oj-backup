<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A burglar got into a matches warehouse and wants to steal as many matches as possible. In the warehouse there are $ m $ containers, in the $ i $ -th container there are $ a_{i} $ matchboxes, and each matchbox contains $ b_{i} $ matches. All the matchboxes are of the same size. The burglar's rucksack can hold $ n $ matchboxes exactly. Your task is to find out the maximum amount of matches that a burglar can carry away. He has no time to rearrange matches in the matchboxes, that's why he just chooses not more than $ n $ matchboxes so that the total amount of matches in them is maximal.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{8} $ ) and integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=20 $ ). The $ i+1 $ -th line contains a pair of numbers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{8},1<=b_{i}<=10 $ ). All the input numbers are integer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
