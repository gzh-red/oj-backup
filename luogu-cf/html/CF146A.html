<h1>Lucky Ticket</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>幸运数字的定义是，这个数字的十进制表示中只有 4 或 7，且若这个数字有 n 位，这个数字的前 n/2 位数码
之和等于后 n/2 位数码之和。现在给出一个 n 位数字，问它是否是幸运数字。保证 n 是偶数。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya loves tickets very much. As we know, each ticket has a number that is a positive integer. Its length equals $ n $ ( $ n $ is always even). Petya calls a ticket lucky if the ticket's number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (the sum of the first $ n/2 $ digits) equals the sum of digits in the second half (the sum of the last $ n/2 $ digits). Check if the given ticket is lucky.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an even integer $ n $ $ (2<=n<=50) $ — the length of the ticket number that needs to be checked. The second line contains an integer whose length equals exactly $ n $ — the ticket number. The number may contain leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line print "YES" if the given ticket number is lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half ( $ 4≠7 $ ).
In the second sample the ticket number is not the lucky number.</div>
