<h1>Lovely Matrix</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题意：**
> 给出一个$n*m$的矩阵$(n*m≤10^5)$，给出一种方案，使得每一行的元素值非严格单调递增。**矩阵中为$-1$的地方可以为任何数**
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Lenny had an $ n×m $ matrix of positive integers. He loved the matrix so much, because each row of the matrix was sorted in non-decreasing order. For the same reason he calls such matrices of integers lovely.
One day when Lenny was at school his little brother was playing with Lenny's matrix in his room. He erased some of the entries of the matrix and changed the order of some of its columns. When Lenny got back home he was very upset. Now Lenny wants to recover his matrix.
Help him to find an order for the columns of the matrix so that it's possible to fill in the erased entries of the matrix to achieve a lovely matrix again. Note, that you can fill the erased entries of the matrix with any integers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two positive integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n·m<=10^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ space-separated integers representing the matrix. An integer -1 shows an erased entry of the matrix. All other integers (each of them is between $ 0 $ and $ 10^{9} $ inclusive) represent filled entries.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there exists no possible reordering of the columns print -1. Otherwise the output should contain $ m $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{m} $ showing the sought permutation of columns. So, the first column of the lovely matrix will be $ p_{1} $ -th column of the initial matrix, the second column of the lovely matrix will be $ p_{2} $ -th column of the initial matrix and so on.</div>
