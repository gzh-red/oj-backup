<h1>Tokitsukaze and Enhancement</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>游戏中，一个整数HP，表示生命值。
定义A等级，则HP%4==1
定义B等级，则HP%4==3
定义C等级，则HP%4==2
定义D等级，则HP%4==0
同时定义等级A>等级B>等级C>等级D
现在可以加0或1或2点HP,使得等级尽可能高。
输入一个整数表示HP 输出最优时应加的HP点数和最后的等级。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tokitsukaze is one of the characters in the game "Kantai Collection". In this game, every character has a common attribute — health points, shortened to HP.
In general, different values of HP are grouped into $ 4 $ categories:
- Category $ A $ if HP is in the form of $ (4 n + 1) $ , that is, when divided by $ 4 $ , the remainder is $ 1 $ ;
- Category $ B $ if HP is in the form of $ (4 n + 3) $ , that is, when divided by $ 4 $ , the remainder is $ 3 $ ;
- Category $ C $ if HP is in the form of $ (4 n + 2) $ , that is, when divided by $ 4 $ , the remainder is $ 2 $ ;
- Category $ D $ if HP is in the form of $ 4 n $ , that is, when divided by $ 4 $ , the remainder is $ 0 $ .
The above-mentioned $ n $ can be any integer.
These $ 4 $ categories ordered from highest to lowest as $ A > B > C > D $ , which means category $ A $ is the highest and category $ D $ is the lowest.
While playing the game, players can increase the HP of the character. Now, Tokitsukaze wants you to increase her HP by at most $ 2 $ (that is, either by $ 0 $ , $ 1 $ or $ 2 $ ). How much should she increase her HP so that it has the highest possible category?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains a single integer $ x $ ( $ 30 \leq x \leq 100 $ ) — the value Tokitsukaze's HP currently.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print an integer $ a $ ( $ 0 \leq a \leq 2 $ ) and an uppercase letter $ b $ ( $ b \in \lbrace A, B, C, D \rbrace $ ), representing that the best way is to increase her HP by $ a $ , and then the category becomes $ b $ .
Note that the output characters are case-sensitive.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
1 B
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first example, the category of Tokitsukaze's HP is already $ A $ , so you don't need to enhance her ability.
For the second example:
- If you don't increase her HP, its value is still $ 98 $ , which equals to $ (4 \times 24 + 2) $ , and its category is $ C $ .
- If you increase her HP by $ 1 $ , its value becomes $ 99 $ , which equals to $ (4 \times 24 + 3) $ , and its category becomes $ B $ .
- If you increase her HP by $ 2 $ , its value becomes $ 100 $ , which equals to $ (4 \times 25) $ , and its category becomes $ D $ .
Therefore, the best way is to increase her HP by $ 1 $ so that the category of her HP becomes $ B $ .</div>
