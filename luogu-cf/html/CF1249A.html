<h1>Yet Another Dividing into Teams</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个长度为n的序列a1，a2...an，将他们分为若干组，使得每一组没有两个数的差为1，使分的组数尽可能少。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are a coach of a group consisting of $ n $ students. The $ i $ -th student has programming skill $ a_i $ . All students have distinct programming skills. You want to divide them into teams in such a way that:
- No two students $ i $ and $ j $ such that $ |a_i - a_j| = 1 $ belong to the same team (i.e. skills of each pair of students in the same team have the difference strictly greater than $ 1 $ );
- the number of teams is the minimum possible.
You have to answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 100 $ ) — the number of queries. Then $ q $ queries follow.
The first line of the query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of students in the query. The second line of the query contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ , all $ a_i $ are distinct), where $ a_i $ is the programming skill of the $ i $ -th student.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query, print the answer on it — the minimum number of teams you can form if no two students $ i $ and $ j $ such that $ |a_i - a_j| = 1 $ may belong to the same team (i.e. skills of each pair of students in the same team has the difference strictly greater than $ 1 $ )</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query of the example, there are $ n=4 $ students with the skills $ a=[2, 10, 1, 20] $ . There is only one restriction here: the $ 1 $ -st and the $ 3 $ -th students can't be in the same team (because of $ |a_1 - a_3|=|2-1|=1 $ ). It is possible to divide them into $ 2 $ teams: for example, students $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ are in the first team and the student $ 3 $ in the second team.
In the second query of the example, there are $ n=2 $ students with the skills $ a=[3, 6] $ . It is possible to compose just a single team containing both students.</div>
