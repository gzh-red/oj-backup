<h1>Wrong Subtraction</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>已知一个数 $n$ ，你要对它进行 $k$ 次操作。对于每一次操作，如果 $n$ 的最后一位数字不为零，则将它减1，否则将它除以10（即删除最后一位数字）。
给出初始时的数 $n$ 和操作次数 $k$ ，求操作 $k$ 次后的结果。
保证结果是正整数。
感谢@bcr_233 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:
- if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
- if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).
You are given an integer number $ n $ . Tanya will subtract one from it $ k $ times. Your task is to print the result after all $ k $ subtractions.
It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \le k \le 50 $ ) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing $ n $ by one $ k $ times.
It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>512 4

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first example corresponds to the following sequence: $ 512 \rightarrow 511 \rightarrow 510 \rightarrow 51 \rightarrow 50 $ .</div>
