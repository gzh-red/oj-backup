<h1>Annoying Present</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice got an array of length $ n $ as a birthday present once again! This is the third year in a row!
And what is more disappointing, it is overwhelmengly boring, filled entirely with zeros. Bob decided to apply some changes to the array to cheer up Alice.
Bob has chosen $ m $ changes of the following form. For some integer numbers $ x $ and $ d $ , he chooses an arbitrary position $ i $ ( $ 1 \le i \le n $ ) and for every $ j \in [1, n] $ adds $ x + d \cdot dist(i, j) $ to the value of the $ j $ -th cell. $ dist(i, j) $ is the distance between positions $ i $ and $ j $ (i.e. $ dist(i, j) = |i - j| $ , where $ |x| $ is an absolute value of $ x $ ).
For example, if Alice currently has an array $ [2, 1, 2, 2] $ and Bob chooses position $ 3 $ for $ x = -1 $ and $ d = 2 $ then the array will become $ [2 - 1 + 2 \cdot 2,~1 - 1 + 2 \cdot 1,~2 - 1 + 2 \cdot 0,~2 - 1 + 2 \cdot 1] $ = $ [5, 2, 1, 3] $ . Note that Bob can't choose position $ i $ outside of the array (that is, smaller than $ 1 $ or greater than $ n $ ).
Alice will be the happiest when the elements of the array are as big as possible. Bob claimed that the arithmetic mean value of the elements will work fine as a metric.
What is the maximum arithmetic mean value Bob can achieve?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of elements of the array and the number of changes.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ d_i $ ( $ -10^3 \le x_i, d_i \le 10^3 $ ) — the parameters for the $ i $ -th change.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximal average arithmetic mean of the elements Bob can achieve.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
