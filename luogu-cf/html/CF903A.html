<h1>Hungry Student Problem</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>珂朵莉要吃x块几块，有3块一盒的小鸡块和7块一盒的大鸡块，能不能买恰好x块鸡块？
x<=100
感谢@partychicken 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan's classes at the university have just finished, and now he wants to go to the local CFK cafe and eat some fried chicken.
CFK sells chicken chunks in small and large portions. A small portion contains $ 3 $ chunks; a large one — $ 7 $ chunks. Ivan wants to eat exactly $ x $ chunks. Now he wonders whether he can buy exactly this amount of chicken.
Formally, Ivan wants to know if he can choose two non-negative integers $ a $ and $ b $ in such a way that $ a $ small portions and $ b $ large ones contain exactly $ x $ chunks.
Help Ivan to answer this question for several values of $ x $ !</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of testcases.
The $ i $ -th of the following $ n $ lines contains one integer $ x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=100 $ ) — the number of chicken chunks Ivan wants to eat.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ lines, in $ i $ -th line output YES if Ivan can buy exactly $ x_{i} $ chunks. Otherwise, print NO.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
6
5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Ivan can buy two small portions.
In the second example Ivan cannot buy exactly $ 5 $ chunks, since one small portion is not enough, but two small portions or one large is too much.</div>
