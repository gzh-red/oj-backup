<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## Description
你有一个本子，你要往上面写全部的长度为$n$的$b$进制数字，每一页可以写$c$个。要求所有数字必须严格不含前导$0$。求最后一页上有多少个数字
## Input
三个数，依次是进制数$b$,数字长度$n$，每一页的个数$c$。
## Output
一行一个整数代表答案
## Hint
$Forall:$
$2~\leq~b~<~10^{10^6}~,~1~\leq~n~<~10^{10^6}~,~1~\leq~c~\leq~10^9$

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Nick is attracted by everything unconventional. He doesn't like decimal number system any more, and he decided to study other number systems. A number system with base $ b $ caught his attention. Before he starts studying it, he wants to write in his notepad all the numbers of length $ n $ without leading zeros in this number system. Each page in Nick's notepad has enough space for $ c $ numbers exactly. Nick writes every suitable number only once, starting with the first clean page and leaving no clean spaces. Nick never writes number $ 0 $ as he has unpleasant memories about zero divide.
Would you help Nick find out how many numbers will be written on the last page.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only input line contains three space-separated integers $ b $ , $ n $ and $ c $ ( $ 2<=b<10^{106} $ , $ 1<=n<10^{106} $ , $ 1<=c<=10^{9} $ ). You may consider that Nick has infinite patience, endless amount of paper and representations of digits as characters. The numbers doesn't contain leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line output the amount of numbers written on the same page as the last number.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2 3 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>2 3 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In both samples there are exactly $ 4 $ numbers of length $ 3 $ in binary number system. In the first sample Nick writes $ 3 $ numbers on the first page and $ 1 $ on the second page. In the second sample all the $ 4 $ numbers can be written on the first page.</div>
