<h1>Substrings Sort</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述：
给定一个数n和n个字符串，求一个重新排列，对于新排列中的每个字符串
都满足在它前面的串都是它的子串。
输入格式：
第一行n，第二行开始n个字符串
输出格式：
按照题目描述，若可行则输出“YES”和n个新排列的字符串，否则“NO”，不含引号。
感谢@南方不败 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.
String $ a $ is a substring of string $ b $ if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in $ b $ in such a way that they form $ a $ . For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of strings.
The next $ n $ lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from $ 1 $ to $ 100 $ , inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.
Some strings might be equal.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is impossible to reorder $ n $ given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and $ n $ given strings in required order.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string "abab" is not a substring of the string "abacaba".</div>
