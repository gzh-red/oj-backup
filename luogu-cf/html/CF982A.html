<h1>Row</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
### 读入一个字符串，只含有$01$两种字符，合法则输出"$Yes$",否则输出"$No$"。
### 不合法情况
$1$.一个为$0$的字符两旁没有$1$。
$2$.一个为$1$的字符两旁还有$1$。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
共两行。第一行为一个正整数$n$，表示字符串的长度。第二行为一个字符串。
### 输出格式
共一行。为字符串是否合法，合法输出"$Yes$",否则输出"$No$"，判断方法如题目描述中所说。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You're given a row with $ n $ chairs. We call a seating of people "maximal" if the two following conditions hold:
1. There are no neighbors adjacent to anyone seated.
2. It's impossible to seat one more person without violating the first rule.
The seating is given as a string consisting of zeros and ones ( $ 0 $ means that the corresponding seat is empty, $ 1 $ — occupied). The goal is to determine whether this seating is "maximal".
Note that the first and last seats are not adjacent (if $ n \ne 2 $ ).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 1000 $ ) — the number of chairs.
The next line contains a string of $ n $ characters, each of them is either zero or one, describing the seating.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "Yes" (without quotation marks) if the seating is "maximal". Otherwise print "No".
You are allowed to print letters in whatever case you'd like (uppercase or lowercase).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In sample case one the given seating is maximal.
In sample case two the person at chair three has a neighbour to the right.
In sample case three it is possible to seat yet another person into chair three.</div>
