<h1>Escape from Stones</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Squirrel Liss lived in a forest peacefully, but unexpected trouble happens. Stones fall from a mountain. Initially Squirrel Liss occupies an interval $ [0,1] $ . Next, $ n $ stones will fall and Liss will escape from the stones. The stones are numbered from 1 to $ n $ in order.
The stones always fall to the center of Liss's interval. When Liss occupies the interval $ [k-d,k+d] $ and a stone falls to $ k $ , she will escape to the left or to the right. If she escapes to the left, her new interval will be $ [k-d,k] $ . If she escapes to the right, her new interval will be $ [k,k+d] $ .
You are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ . If the $ i $ -th character of $ s $ is "l" or "r", when the $ i $ -th stone falls Liss will escape to the left or to the right, respectively. Find the sequence of stones' numbers from left to right after all the $ n $ stones falls.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of only one line. The only line contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=10^{6} $ ). Each character in $ s $ will be either "l" or "r".</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ lines — on the $ i $ -th line you should print the $ i $ -th stone's number from the left.</div>
