<h1>Panoramix&#039;s Prediction</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入两个正整数n,m(2<=n<m<=50)，如果n和m是连续的质数，输出"YES"，否则输出"NO"。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A prime number is a number which has exactly two distinct divisors: one and itself. For example, numbers $ 2 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 3 $ are prime, and $ 1 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 4 $ are not.
The next prime number after $ x $ is the smallest prime number greater than $ x $ . For example, the next prime number after $ 2 $ is $ 3 $ , and the next prime number after $ 3 $ is $ 5 $ . Note that there is exactly one next prime number after each number. So $ 5 $ is not the next prime number for $ 2 $ .
One cold April morning Panoramix predicted that soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a black day for the residents of the Gallic countryside.
Panoramix's prophecy tells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly $ x $ Roman soldiers, where $ x $ is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly $ y $ Roman soldiers, where $ y $ is the next prime number after $ x $ , then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for nothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song.
Yesterday the Gauls beat $ n $ Roman soldiers and it turned out that the number $ n $ was prime! Today their victims were a troop of $ m $ Romans ( $ m&gt;n $ ). Determine whether the Gauls should wait for the black day after today's victory of Asterix and Obelix?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only input line contains two positive integers — $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n&lt;m<=50 $ ). It is guaranteed that $ n $ is prime.
Pretests contain all the cases with restrictions $ 2<=n&lt;m<=4 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print YES, if $ m $ is the next prime number after $ n $ , or NO otherwise.</div>
