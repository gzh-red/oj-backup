<h1>USB Flash Drives</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Sean正在把一个大文件考到n个U盘里。这个文件足有m MB那么大。第i个U盘的容量是a[i]。
假设Sean能把文件分装到多个U盘中，请求出他最少需要用多少个U盘来考这个文件。
### 输入输出格式
#### 输入格式
第一行包括一个整数n(1<=n<=100)-U盘的个数。
第二行包含一个整数m(1<=m<=10^5)-文件的大小。
以下n行每一行包括一个整数a[i] (1<=a[i]<=1000)-第i个U盘的大小。
确定答案出现-也就是说所有a[i]的总和不小于m。
#### 输出格式
输出至少要多少U盘。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sean is trying to save a large file to a USB flash drive. He has $ n $ USB flash drives with capacities equal to $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ megabytes. The file size is equal to $ m $ megabytes.
Find the minimum number of USB flash drives needed to write Sean's file, if he can split the file between drives.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains positive integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of USB flash drives.
The second line contains positive integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=10^{5} $ ) — the size of Sean's file.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains positive integer $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=1000 $ ) — the sizes of USB flash drives in megabytes.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i. e. the sum of all $ a_{i} $ is not less than $ m $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
