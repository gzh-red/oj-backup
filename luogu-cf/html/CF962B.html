<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ consecutive seat places in a railway carriage. Each place is either empty or occupied by a passenger.
The university team for the Olympiad consists of $ a $ student-programmers and $ b $ student-athletes. Determine the largest number of students from all $ a+b $ students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that:
- no student-programmer is sitting next to the student-programmer;
- and no student-athlete is sitting next to the student-athlete.
In the other words, there should not be two consecutive (adjacent) places where two student-athletes or two student-programmers are sitting.
Consider that initially occupied seat places are occupied by jury members (who obviously are not students at all).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contain three integers $ n $ , $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^{5} $ , $ 0 \le a, b \le 2\cdot10^{5} $ , $ a + b > 0 $ ) — total number of seat places in the railway carriage, the number of student-programmers and the number of student-athletes.
The second line contains a string with length $ n $ , consisting of characters "." and "\*". The dot means that the corresponding place is empty. The asterisk means that the corresponding place is occupied by the jury member.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
