<h1>Parallelepiped</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有个长方体，你知道其中有公共定点的三个面的面积，求12条边边长和</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive $ (&gt;0) $ and do not exceed $ 10^{4} $ . It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.</div>
