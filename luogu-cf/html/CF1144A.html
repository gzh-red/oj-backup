<h1>Diverse Strings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目简述
有$n$次询问，每次询问一个字符串$st$是否合法。合法输出"Yes"，否则输出"No"。每次询问以及回答都要换一行。
“合法”：所有单个字母都是连续排列，但这并不意味着必须要严格相邻连续，如$\mathrm{fced}$和$\mathrm{r}$是合法的。
“不合法”：字母不连续排列的以及重复出现同一个字母。如$\mathrm{az}$和$\mathrm{babc}$
“连续排列”：即按照字母表顺序。注意'A'和'Z'不是相邻的。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A string is called diverse if it contains consecutive (adjacent) letters of the Latin alphabet and each letter occurs exactly once. For example, the following strings are diverse: "fced", "xyz", "r" and "dabcef". The following string are not diverse: "az", "aa", "bad" and "babc". Note that the letters 'a' and 'z' are not adjacent.
Formally, consider positions of all letters in the string in the alphabet. These positions should form contiguous segment, i.e. they should come one by one without any gaps.
You are given a sequence of strings. For each string, if it is diverse, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ), denoting the number of strings to process. The following $ n $ lines contains strings, one string per line. Each string contains only lowercase Latin letters, its length is between $ 1 $ and $ 100 $ , inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ lines, one line per a string in the input. The line should contain "Yes" if the corresponding string is diverse and "No" if the corresponding string is not diverse. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). For example, "YeS", "no" and "yES" are all acceptable.</div>
