<h1>DZY Loves Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>DZY loves collecting special strings which only contain lowercase letters. For each lowercase letter $ c $ DZY knows its value $ w_{c} $ . For each special string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ ( $ |s| $ is the length of the string) he represents its value with a function $ f(s) $ , where
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF447B/47a1fab5618b8aab7370048ef8382ed56e397765.png)Now DZY has a string $ s $ . He wants to insert $ k $ lowercase letters into this string in order to get the largest possible value of the resulting string. Can you help him calculate the largest possible value he could get?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single string $ s (1<=|s|<=10^{3}) $ .
The second line contains a single integer $ k (0<=k<=10^{3}) $ .
The third line contains twenty-six integers from $ w_{a} $ to $ w_{z} $ . Each such number is non-negative and doesn't exceed $ 1000 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the largest possible value of the resulting string DZY could get.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>abc
3
1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>41

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the test sample DZY can obtain "abcbbc", $ value=1·1+2·2+3·2+4·2+5·2+6·2=41 $ .</div>
