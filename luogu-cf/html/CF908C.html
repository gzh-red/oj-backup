<h1>New Year and Curling</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意： 已知一些圆在($x_i$,$10^{100}$)处，然后依次落下，下落时只要碰到某个圆，就会停止，求这些圆的最后的y值，也即是水平高度
相切也会停止，求的是圆心的y值
Translated by @远航之曲 @yybyyb</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Carol is currently curling.
She has $ n $ disks each with radius $ r $ on the 2D plane.
Initially she has all these disks above the line $ y=10^{100} $ .
She then will slide the disks towards the line $ y=0 $ one by one in order from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .
When she slides the $ i $ -th disk, she will place its center at the point $ (x_{i},10^{100}) $ . She will then push it so the disk’s $ y $ coordinate continuously decreases, and $ x $ coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the line $ y=0 $ or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk.
Compute the $ y $ -coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will contain two integers $ n $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=n,r<=1000 $ ), the number of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively.
The next line will contain $ n $ integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=1000 $ ) — the $ x $ -coordinates of the disks.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single line with $ n $ numbers. The $ i $ -th number denotes the $ y $ -coordinate of the center of the $ i $ -th disk. The output will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most $ 10^{-6} $ .
Namely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate is $ a $ and the answer of the jury is $ b $ . The checker program will consider your answer correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF908C/259203790d90e969d73ec841bd0673c1e8e7d69a.png) for all coordinates.</div>
