<h1>Petya and File System</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小彼佳决定算文件夹中包含的子文件夹（包括嵌套文件夹，大多数嵌套嵌套文件夹，文件夹等等）和文件夹中包含的文件（包括子文件夹中的文件）。 下面的样例可以帮助你更好的了解文件和文件夹： 每一个文件的路径如下： diskname:\folder1\folder2\…\foldern\filename diskname是C D E F G五个字母中的一个 folder1，…，foldern是文件夹名称。每个文件夹的名字是非空序列的小写拉丁字母和数字0到9组成的。 请编程找到同一文件夹中包含的最多文件数量和文件夹中包含的最多的子文件夹数量。
### 输入数据
输入数据的每行包含一个文件路径的描述，长度不超过100，而且一共不超过100行。保证每个地址都是合法的，并且每个文件都只有一次描述。输入数据中至少有一行。
### 输出数据
打印2个数用空格隔开。第一个是在一个文件夹的子文件夹的最大可能数（包括嵌套文件夹嵌套嵌套文件夹，文件夹等等）。第二个文件夹中文件的最大数目（包括嵌套的子目录的文件）。磁盘不是文件夹

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently, on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer. But he got soon fed up with this activity, and he decided to do a much more useful thing. He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on) and what folder contains most files (including the files in the subfolders).
More formally, the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders. The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself. A file is regarded as lying in a folder, if and only if it either lies directly in this folder, or lies in some subfolder of the folder.
For a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer, see notes and answers to the samples.
You are given a few files that Petya has managed to create. The path to each file looks as follows:
$ diskName $ : $ \ $ $ folder_{1} $ $ \ $ $ folder_{2} $ $ \...\ $ $ folder_{n} $ $ \ $ $ fileName $
- $ diskName $ is single capital letter from the set {C,D,E,F,G}.
- $ folder_{1} $ , ..., $ folder_{n} $ are folder names. Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9. ( $ n>=1 $ )
- $ fileName $ is a file name in the form of $ name $ . $ extension $ , where the $ name $ and the $ extension $ are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9.
It is also known that there is no file whose path looks like $ diskName $ : $ \ $ $ fileName $ . That is, each file is stored in some folder, but there are no files directly in the root. Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folder.
Help Petya to find the largest number of subfolders, which can be in some folder, and the largest number of files that can be in some folder, counting all its subfolders.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each line of input data contains the description of one file path. The length of each line does not exceed 100, and overall there are no more than 100 lines. It is guaranteed, that all the paths are correct and meet the above rules. It is also guaranteed, that there are no two completely equal lines. That is, each file is described exactly once.
There is at least one line in the input data.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two space-separated numbers. The first one is the maximal number of possible subfolders in a folder (including nested folders, nested folders of nested folders, and so on). The second one is the maximal number of files in a folder (including nested files in subfolders). Note that the disks are not regarded as folders.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample we have one folder on the "C" disk. It has no subfolders, which is why the first number in the answer is $ 0 $ . But this folder contains one file, so the second number of the answer is $ 1 $ .
In the second sample we have several different folders. Consider the "folder1" folder on the "C" disk. This folder directly contains one folder, "folder2". The "folder2" folder contains two more folders — "folder3" and "folder4". Thus, the "folder1" folder on the "C" drive has exactly $ 3 $ subfolders. Also this folder contains two files, even though they do not lie directly in the folder, but they are located in subfolders of "folder1".
In the third example we see that the names of some folders and some subfolders are identical. Consider the "file" folder, which lies directly on the "C" disk. That folder contains another "file" folder, which in turn contains another "file" folder, which contains two more folders, "file" and "file2". Thus, the "file" folder, which lies directly on the "C" disk, contains $ 4 $ subfolders.</div>
