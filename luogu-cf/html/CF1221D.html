<h1>Make The Fence Great Again</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$n$个数，定义一个数列是好的当且仅当$a_{i}\ne a_{i-1}$
你可以通过调整数的大小来把一个数列变成好的，将一个位置$i$上的数$+1$需要的花费是$b_i$，问：最小的花费
有$q$组询问，保证$\sum_{i=1}^q n_i\le3\times10^5$，答案在$long\ long$范围内</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a fence consisting of $ n $ vertical boards. The width of each board is $ 1 $ . The height of the $ i $ -th board is $ a_i $ . You think that the fence is great if there is no pair of adjacent boards having the same height. More formally, the fence is great if and only if for all indices from $ 2 $ to $ n $ , the condition $ a_{i-1} \neq a_i $ holds.
Unfortunately, it is possible that now your fence is not great. But you can change it! You can increase the length of the $ i $ -th board by $ 1 $ , but you have to pay $ b_i $ rubles for it. The length of each board can be increased any number of times (possibly, zero).
Calculate the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make the fence great again!
You have to answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of queries.
The first line of each query contains one integers $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of boards in the fence.
The following $ n $ lines of each query contain the descriptions of the boards. The $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9 $ ) — the length of the $ i $ -th board and the price for increasing it by $ 1 $ , respectively.
It is guaranteed that sum of all $ n $ over all queries not exceed $ 3 \cdot 10^5 $ .
It is guaranteed that answer to each query will not exceed $ 10^{18} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print one integer — the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make the fence great.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first query you have to increase the length of second board by $ 2 $ . So your total costs if $ 2 \cdot b_2 = 2 $ .
In the second query you have to increase the length of first board by $ 1 $ and the length of third board by $ 1 $ . So your total costs if $ 1 \cdot b_1 + 1 \cdot b_3 = 9 $ .
In the third query the fence is great initially, so you don't need to spend rubles.</div>
