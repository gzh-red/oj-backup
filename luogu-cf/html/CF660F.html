<h1>Bear and Bowling 4</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个长度为$n$ 的序列,第$i$ 个数是$a_i$ ，选取一个连续子序列$\{a_x,a_{x+1},\dots ,a_{x+k-1}\}$ 使得$\sum_{i=1}^k i\cdot a_{x+i-1}$ 最大。
其中$1\leq n\leq 2\times 10^5,|a_i|\leq 10^7$
感谢@Durant_Lee 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Limak is an old brown bear. He often goes bowling with his friends. Today he feels really good and tries to beat his own record!
For rolling a ball one gets a score — an integer (maybe negative) number of points. Score for the $ i $ -th roll is multiplied by $ i $ and scores are summed up. So, for $ k $ rolls with scores $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , the total score is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF660F/dc22606298d977fae92bc67b7a4815c447193831.png). The total score is $ 0 $ if there were no rolls.
Limak made $ n $ rolls and got score $ a_{i} $ for the $ i $ -th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He can say that some first rolls were only a warm-up, and that he wasn't focused during the last rolls. More formally, he can cancel any prefix and any suffix of the sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . It is allowed to cancel all rolls, or to cancel none of them.
The total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. So, the first non-canceled roll has score multiplied by $ 1 $ , the second one has score multiplied by $ 2 $ , and so on, till the last non-canceled roll.
What maximum total score can Limak get?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the total number of rolls made by Limak.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ |a_{i}|<=10^{7}) $ — scores for Limak's rolls.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible total score after cancelling rolls.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test, Limak should cancel the first two rolls, and one last roll. He will be left with rolls $ 1,-3,7 $ what gives him the total score $ 1·1+2·(-3)+3·7=1-6+21=16 $ .</div>
