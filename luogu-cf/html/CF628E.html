<h1>Zbazi in Zeydabad</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个$n\times m$的矩阵, 每个格点为'.'或'z'。
我们称一个子矩阵合法, 当且仅当这个矩阵为正方形, 且该矩阵的第一行和最后一行元素全部为'z', 从右上到左下的对角线上元素全部为'z', 其余位置元素随意。注意, 一个$1\times 1$的内容为'z'的矩阵是合法的。
$n, m\leq 3000$, 输出所有合法矩阵的数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A tourist wants to visit country Zeydabad for Zbazi (a local game in Zeydabad).
The country Zeydabad is a rectangular table consisting of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. Each cell on the country is either 'z' or '.'.
The tourist knows this country is named Zeydabad because there are lots of ''Z-pattern"s in the country. A ''Z-pattern" is a square which anti-diagonal is completely filled with 'z' and its upper and lower rows are also completely filled with 'z'. All other cells of a square can be arbitrary.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628E/1dd3a4a39a26eabd5113af3bad685b4a12148713.png)Note that a ''Z-pattern" can consist of only one cell (see the examples).
So he wants to count the number of ''Z-pattern"s in the country (a necessary skill for Zbazi).
Now your task is to help tourist with counting number of ''Z-pattern"s.
As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n,m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=3000 $ ) — the number of rows and columns respectively.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters 'z' or '.' — the description of Zeydabad.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the only integer $ a $ — the number of ''Z-pattern"s in Zeydabad.</div>
