<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The plans for HC $ ^{2} $ are rather far-fetched: we are just over 500 000 days away from HC $ ^{2} $ 3387, for example, and accordingly we are planning to have a couple hundred thousand problems in that edition (we hope that programming contests will become wildly more popular). The marmots need to get to work, and they could use a good plan...</div>
