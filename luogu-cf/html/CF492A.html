<h1>Vanya and Cubes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Vanya得到了 $n$ 个立方体。
他决定建造一座金字塔。
Vanya想要建造金字塔如下：
金字塔的顶层必须由 $1$ 个立方体组成，
第二层必须由 $1+2=3$ 个立方体组成，
第三层必须有 $1+2+3=6$ 个立方体.....
依此类推。
因此，金字塔的第i级必须具有
$1+2+...+(i-1)+ i$ 个立方体。
Vanya想要知道他可以使用给定的立方体制作金字塔的最大高度。
感谢@HNFMS__viston 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vanya got $ n $ cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of $ 1 $ cube, the second level must consist of $ 1+2=3 $ cubes, the third level must have $ 1+2+3=6 $ cubes, and so on. Thus, the $ i $ -th level of the pyramid must have $ 1+2+...+(i-1)+i $ cubes.
Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.</div>
