<h1>Sweets Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个19个点组成的的六边形巧克力盒子，现在Karlsson和Lillebror在玩游戏，Karlsson先手，每次可以取走在一条直线上连续的任意个数的巧克力（见图）。
输入这个盒子，用'O'表示巧克力，'.'表示空位，数据保证盒子里只少有一颗巧克力；输出获胜者的名字。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Karlsson has visited Lillebror again. They found a box of chocolates and a big whipped cream cake at Lillebror's place. Karlsson immediately suggested to divide the sweets fairly between Lillebror and himself. Specifically, to play together a game he has just invented with the chocolates. The winner will get the cake as a reward.
The box of chocolates has the form of a hexagon. It contains 19 cells for the chocolates, some of which contain a chocolate. The players move in turns. During one move it is allowed to eat one or several chocolates that lay in the neighboring cells on one line, parallel to one of the box's sides. The picture below shows the examples of allowed moves and of an unacceptable one. The player who cannot make a move loses.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF63E/d39dc87a25b4bbc8e9ef90055ec2e2d8c38df358.png)Karlsson makes the first move as he is Lillebror's guest and not vice versa. The players play optimally. Determine who will get the cake.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data contains 5 lines, containing 19 words consisting of one symbol. The word "O" means that the cell contains a chocolate and a "." stands for an empty cell. It is guaranteed that the box contains at least one chocolate. See the examples for better understanding.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Karlsson gets the cake, print "Karlsson" (without the quotes), otherwise print "Lillebror" (yet again without the quotes).</div>
