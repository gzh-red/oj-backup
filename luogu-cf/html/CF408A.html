<h1>Line to Cashier</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Vasya went to the supermarket to get some groceries. He walked about the supermarket for a long time and got a basket full of products. Now he needs to choose the cashier to pay for the products.
There are $ n $ cashiers at the exit from the supermarket. At the moment the queue for the $ i $ -th cashier already has $ k_{i} $ people. The $ j $ -th person standing in the queue to the $ i $ -th cashier has $ m_{i,j} $ items in the basket. Vasya knows that:
- the cashier needs 5 seconds to scan one item;
- after the cashier scans each item of some customer, he needs 15 seconds to take the customer's money and give him the change.
Of course, Vasya wants to select a queue so that he can leave the supermarket as soon as possible. Help him write a program that displays the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of cashes in the shop. The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers: $ k_{1},k_{2},...,k_{n} $ ( $ 1<=k_{i}<=100 $ ), where $ k_{i} $ is the number of people in the queue to the $ i $ -th cashier.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains $ k_{i} $ space-separated integers: $ m_{i,1},m_{i,2},...,m_{i,ki} $ ( $ 1<=m_{i,j}<=100 $ ) — the number of products the $ j $ -th person in the queue for the $ i $ -th cash has.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds Vasya needs to get to the cashier.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the second test sample, if Vasya goes to the first queue, he gets to the cashier in $ 100·5+15=515 $ seconds. But if he chooses the second queue, he will need $ 1·5+2·5+2·5+3·5+4·15=100 $ seconds. He will need $ 1·5+9·5+1·5+3·15=100 $ seconds for the third one and $ 7·5+8·5+2·15=105 $ seconds for the fourth one. Thus, Vasya gets to the cashier quicker if he chooses the second or the third queue.</div>
