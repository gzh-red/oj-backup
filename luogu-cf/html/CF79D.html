<h1>Password</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有$n$个灯泡，一开始都未点亮
同时你有$l$个长度，分别为$a_1 \sim a_l$
每次你可以选择一段连续的子序列，且长度为某个$a_i$，并将这些灯泡的明灭状态取反
你可以做任意多次，使得最后有且仅有$k$个位置是亮的，这些位置已经给定，为$x_1 \sim x_k$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Finally Fox Ciel arrived in front of her castle!
She have to type a password to enter her castle. An input device attached to her castle is a bit unusual.
The input device is a $ 1×n $ rectangle divided into $ n $ square panels. They are numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ from left to right. Each panel has a state either ON or OFF. Initially all panels are in the OFF state. She can enter her castle if and only if $ x_{1} $ -th, $ x_{2} $ -th, $ ... $ , $ x_{k} $ -th panels are in the ON state and other panels are in the OFF state.
She is given an array $ a_{1} $ , $ ... $ , $ a_{l} $ . In each move, she can perform the following operation: choose an index $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=l $ ), choose consecutive $ a_{i} $ panels, and flip the states of those panels (i.e. ON $ → $ OFF, OFF $ → $ ON).
Unfortunately she forgets how to type the password with only above operations. Determine the minimal number of operations required to enter her castle.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ k $ and $ l $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000,1<=k<=10,1<=l<=100 $ ), separated by single spaces.
The second line contains $ k $ integers $ x_{1} $ , ..., $ x_{k} $ ( $ 1<=x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;...&lt;x_{k}<=n $ ), separated by single spaces.
The third line contains $ l $ integers $ a_{1} $ , ..., $ a_{l} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ), separated by single spaces. It is possible that some elements of the array $ a_{i} $ are equal value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimal number of moves required to type the password. If it's impossible, print -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>10 8 2
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
3 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3 2 1
1 2
3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>-1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>One possible way to type the password in the first example is following: In the first move, choose 1st, 2nd, 3rd panels and flip those panels. In the second move, choose 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th panels and flip those panels.</div>
