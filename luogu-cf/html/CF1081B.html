<h1>Farewell Party</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>n个人参加聚会，每个人戴着一顶帽子，帽子编号在[1,n]范围内，第i个人知道有ai个人的帽子种类和他不同。读入a1,...,an，问是否存在合法解？若存在则输出一行Possible，并在下一行输出每个人戴的帽子种类（如有多解输出任意一种即可）；若不存在输出Impossible</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chouti and his classmates are going to the university soon. To say goodbye to each other, the class has planned a big farewell party in which classmates, teachers and parents sang and danced.
Chouti remembered that $ n $ persons took part in that party. To make the party funnier, each person wore one hat among $ n $ kinds of weird hats numbered $ 1, 2, \ldots n $ . It is possible that several persons wore hats of the same kind. Some kinds of hats can remain unclaimed by anyone.
After the party, the $ i $ -th person said that there were $ a_i $ persons wearing a hat differing from his own.
It has been some days, so Chouti forgot all about others' hats, but he is curious about that. Let $ b_i $ be the number of hat type the $ i $ -th person was wearing, Chouti wants you to find any possible $ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n $ that doesn't contradict with any person's statement. Because some persons might have a poor memory, there could be no solution at all.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ), the number of persons in the party.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \le n-1 $ ), the statements of people.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no solution, print a single line "Impossible".
Otherwise, print "Possible" and then $ n $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n $ ( $ 1 \le b_i \le n $ ).
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Possible

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>Impossible
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the answer to the first example, all hats are the same, so every person will say that there were no persons wearing a hat different from kind $ 1 $ .
In the answer to the second example, the first and the second person wore the hat with type $ 1 $ and all other wore a hat of type $ 2 $ .
So the first two persons will say there were three persons with hats differing from their own. Similarly, three last persons will say there were two persons wearing a hat different from their own.
In the third example, it can be shown that no solution exists.
In the first and the second example, other possible configurations are possible.</div>
