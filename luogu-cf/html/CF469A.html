<h1>I Wanna Be the Guy</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小X和小Y最近在玩一个叫做I wanna be the guy的游戏，这个游戏有$n$个关卡。把$n$个关卡都通过后，那么就完成游戏了。
可是小X只能过$p$关，小Y只能过$q$关。因为他们能力有限，所以他们决定合作。
给出小X和小Y能通过的关卡，他们能完成这个游戏吗？如果可以，输出`I become the guy.`，否则，输出`Oh, my keyboard!`。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of $ n $ levels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.
Little X can pass only $ p $ levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only $ q $ levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ).
The next line contains an integer $ p $ $ (0<=p<=n) $ at first, then follows $ p $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{p} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n) $ . These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If they can pass all the levels, print "I become the guy.". If it's impossible, print "Oh, my keyboard!" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
3 1 2 3
2 2 4
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>I become the guy.
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4
3 1 2 3
2 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Oh, my keyboard!
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Little X can pass levels \[1 2 3\], and Little Y can pass level \[2 4\], so they can pass all the levels both.
In the second sample, no one can pass level 4.</div>
