<h1>Anton and Polyhedrons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Anton最喜欢的几何图形是正多面体。
有五种正多面体：
四面体：有4个4个三角形的面。
立方体：有6个6正方形的面。
八面体：有8个8个三角形的面。
十二面体：有12个12个五边形的面。
二十面体:有20个20个三角形的面。
形状如图：
编写程序，帮Anton求出他的n个多面体的总面数s。
输入输出格式
输入：
第一行为一个整数N（1<n<＝200000） 第2~n+1行包含一个字符串s[i]（Anton集合中的第i个多面体的名称） 输入方式如下（不带引号）： “Tetrahedron”表示四面体； “Cube”表示立方体； “Octahedron”表示八面体； “Dodecahedron”表示十二面体； “Icosahedron”表示二十面体。 输出格式： 输出一个整数s。 说明： 在第一个样例输入中，Anton有一个二十面体、一个立方体、一个四面体和一个十二面体。二十面体有20个面，立方体有6个面，四面体有4个面，十二面体有12个面。所以，它们一共有20 + 6 + 4 + 12＝42个面。 （好水的题目）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons:
- Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has $ 4 $ triangular faces.
- Cube. Cube has $ 6 $ square faces.
- Octahedron. Octahedron has $ 8 $ triangular faces.
- Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has $ 12 $ pentagonal faces.
- Icosahedron. Icosahedron has $ 20 $ triangular faces.
All five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=200000) $ — the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.
Each of the following $ n $ lines of the input contains a string $ s_{i} $ — the name of the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:
- "Tetrahedron" (without quotes), if the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.
- "Cube" (without quotes), if the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.
- "Octahedron" (without quotes), if the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.
- "Dodecahedron" (without quotes), if the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.
- "Icosahedron" (without quotes), if the $ i $ -th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.</div>
