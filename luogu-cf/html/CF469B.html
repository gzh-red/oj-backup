<h1>Chat Online</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little X and Little Z are good friends. They always chat online. But both of them have schedules.
Little Z has fixed schedule. He always online at any moment of time between $ a_{1} $ and $ b_{1} $ , between $ a_{2} $ and $ b_{2} $ , ..., between $ a_{p} $ and $ b_{p} $ (all borders inclusive). But the schedule of Little X is quite strange, it depends on the time when he gets up. If he gets up at time $ 0 $ , he will be online at any moment of time between $ c_{1} $ and $ d_{1} $ , between $ c_{2} $ and $ d_{2} $ , ..., between $ c_{q} $ and $ d_{q} $ (all borders inclusive). But if he gets up at time $ t $ , these segments will be shifted by $ t $ . They become $ [c_{i}+t,d_{i}+t] $ (for all $ i $ ).
If at a moment of time, both Little X and Little Z are online simultaneosly, they can chat online happily. You know that Little X can get up at an integer moment of time between $ l $ and $ r $ (both borders inclusive). Also you know that Little X wants to get up at the moment of time, that is suitable for chatting with Little Z (they must have at least one common moment of time in schedules). How many integer moments of time from the segment $ [l,r] $ suit for that?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four space-separated integers $ p,q,l,r $ ( $ 1<=p,q<=50; 0<=l<=r<=1000 $ ).
Each of the next $ p $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}&lt;b_{i}<=1000 $ ). Each of the next $ q $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ c_{j},d_{j} $ ( $ 0<=c_{j}&lt;d_{j}<=1000 $ ).
It's guaranteed that $ b_{i}&lt;a_{i+1} $ and $ d_{j}&lt;c_{j+1} $ for all valid $ i $ and $ j $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer — the number of moments of time from the segment $ [l,r] $ which suit for online conversation.</div>
