<h1>3-palindrome</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
给定n，求长度为n的以'a','b'或'c'构成的字符串，使得其中不存在长为3的回文子串（如"abc","abca"均符合，但"aba"不符），并使'c'的个数尽可能少
输入格式：
第一行输入一个整数n（1<=n<=2*10^5）为字符串长度
输出格式：
输出一个满足要求的字符串，若有多个任选一个输出
翻译提供者：mxy1</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the beginning of the new year Keivan decided to reverse his name. He doesn't like palindromes, so he changed Naviek to Navick.
He is too selfish, so for a given $ n $ he wants to obtain a string of $ n $ characters, each of which is either 'a', 'b' or 'c', with no palindromes of length $ 3 $ appearing in the string as a substring. For example, the strings "abc" and "abca" suit him, while the string "aba" doesn't. He also want the number of letters 'c' in his string to be as little as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the length of the string.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the string that satisfies all the constraints.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward.</div>
