<h1>Swaps</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个玩家，围成一圈，第i名玩家拥有ai张卡片，每名玩家的卡片上颜色均相同，不同玩家卡片颜色不同。
玩家可以交换卡片，但必须遵守以下规则：
1.当玩家交换卡片时，玩家只能给对方自己颜色的卡片。
2.玩家不能接受自己已经拥有颜色的卡片。
3.每次交换时，一名玩家得到一张卡片，失去一张卡片。
现在每名玩家想交换光自己颜色的卡片，问你是否可以。如果可以输出Yes，并输出解决方法。如果不行输出No。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ players sitting at a round table. All of them have $ s $ cards of $ n $ colors in total. Besides, initially the first person had cards of only the first color, the second one had cards of only the second color and so on. They can swap the cards by the following rules:
- as the players swap, a player can give a card of his color only;
- a player can't accept a card of a color he already has (particularly, he can't take cards of his color, no matter whether he has given out all of them or not);
- during one swap a pair of people swaps cards (each person gives one card and takes one card).
The aim of all $ n $ people is as follows: each of them should give out all the cards he had initially (that is, all cards of his color). Your task is to denote whether such sequence of swaps is possible. If the answer is positive, you should list all the swaps.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) and $ s $ ( $ 1<=s<=200000 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ numbers, the $ i $ -th number stands for how many cards the $ i $ -th player has by the moment the game starts. It is possible that a player has no cards initially.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line print "No" if such sequence of swaps is impossible. Otherwise, print "Yes". If the answer is positive, next print number $ k $ — the number of the swaps. Then on $ k $ lines describe the swaps by pairs of indices of the swapping players. Print the swaps and the numbers of the swaps in any order.</div>
