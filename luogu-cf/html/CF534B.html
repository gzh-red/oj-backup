<h1>Covered Path</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals $ v_{1} $ meters per second, and in the end it is $ v_{2} $ meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly $ t $ seconds to pass.
Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by $ d $ meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed $ d $ in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ v_{1} $ and $ v_{2} $ ( $ 1<=v_{1},v_{2}<=100 $ ) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.
The second line contains two integers $ t $ ( $ 2<=t<=100 $ ) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, $ d $ $ (0<=d<=10) $ — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.
It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:
- the speed in the first second equals $ v_{1} $ ,
- the speed in the last second equals $ v_{2} $ ,
- the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed $ d $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<div>Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is $ 5+7+8+6=26 $ meters.
In the second sample, as $ d=0 $ , the car covers the whole segment at constant speed $ v=10 $ . In $ t=10 $ seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.</div>
