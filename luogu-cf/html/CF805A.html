<h1>Fake NP</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定区间$[l,r]$ ,令集合$S$ 为区间$[l,r]$ 所有正整数的因子，找出一个因子$x$ ，使得区间$[l,r]$ 中整除$x$ 的数最多</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path.
You are given $ l $ and $ r $ . For all integers from $ l $ to $ r $ , inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except $ 1 $ . Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times.
Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 2<=l<=r<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print single integer, the integer that appears maximum number of times in the divisors.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>19 29
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Definition of a divisor: <https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/divisor-of-an-integer-.html>
The first example: from $ 19 $ to $ 29 $ these numbers are divisible by $ 2 $ : $ {20,22,24,26,28} $ .
The second example: from $ 3 $ to $ 6 $ these numbers are divisible by $ 3 $ : $ {3,6} $ .</div>
