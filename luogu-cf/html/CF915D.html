<h1>Almost Acyclic Graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个n个顶点，m条边的有向图。你允许从其中去掉最多一条边。
你能够去掉最多一条边就让这个图无环吗？我们称一个有向图无环，当且仅当它不包含一个环(起点和终点相同的路径)。
#### 输入格式：
第一行两个正整数$n,m$ $2\le n\le 500,1\le m\le min(n(n-1),100000)$，代表图的顶点数和边数。
接下来$m$行，每行两个数$u,v$，表示有一条从$u$到$v$的有向边($1\le u,v\le n,u\ne v$)。一对$(u,v)$最多出现一次。
#### 输出格式：
如果有可能把这个图变成无环图，输出YES，否则输出NO。
说明：
第一个样例中，去掉$2\to 3$的边即可。
第二个样例中，需要至少去掉两条边（例如$2\to 1$和$2\to 3$）才能让这个图变成无环图。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.
Can you make this graph [acyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=500 $ , $ 1<=m<=min(n(n-1),100000) $ ) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.
Then $ m $ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ denoting a directed edge going from vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ , $ u≠v $ ). Each ordered pair $ (u,v) $ is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from $ u $ to $ v $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you can remove edge ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF915D/f1138b32236a89525fad2b8c02b9cbfbd546dfad.png), and the graph becomes acyclic.
In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF915D/7480c546ca7ee72615c3ded7d769355b1c864f93.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF915D/f1138b32236a89525fad2b8c02b9cbfbd546dfad.png)) in order to make the graph acyclic.</div>
