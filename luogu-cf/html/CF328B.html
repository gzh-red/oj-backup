<h1>Sheldon and Ice Pieces</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Do you remember how Kai constructed the word "eternity" using pieces of ice as components?
Little Sheldon plays with pieces of ice, each piece has exactly one digit between 0 and 9. He wants to construct his favourite number $ t $ . He realized that digits 6 and 9 are very similar, so he can rotate piece of ice with 6 to use as 9 (and vice versa). Similary, 2 and 5 work the same. There is no other pair of digits with similar effect. He called this effect "Digital Mimicry".
Sheldon favourite number is $ t $ . He wants to have as many instances of $ t $ as possible. How many instances he can construct using the given sequence of ice pieces. He can use any piece at most once.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=10000 $ ). The second line contains the sequence of digits on the pieces. The length of line is equal to the number of pieces and between 1 and 200, inclusive. It contains digits between 0 and 9.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the required number of instances.</div>
