<h1>Lost Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个由4 8 15 16 23 42组成的排列，你可以询问任意两个下标上的数的乘积，试着找到并输出这个排列
最多询问4次</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: <https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307>.
The jury guessed some array $ a $ consisting of $ 6 $ integers. There are $ 6 $ special numbers — $ 4 $ , $ 8 $ , $ 15 $ , $ 16 $ , $ 23 $ , $ 42 $ — and each of these numbers occurs in $ a $ exactly once (so, $ a $ is some permutation of these numbers).
You don't know anything about their order, but you are allowed to ask up to $ 4 $ queries. In each query, you may choose two indices $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1 \le i, j \le 6 $ , $ i $ and $ j $ are not necessarily distinct), and you will get the value of $ a_i \cdot a_j $ in return.
Can you guess the array $ a $ ?
The array $ a $ is fixed beforehand in each test, the interaction program doesn't try to adapt to your queries.</div>

<div>Before submitting the answer, you may ask up to $ 4 $ queries. To ask a query, print one line in the following format: $ ? $ $ i $ $ j $ , where $ i $ and $ j $ should be two integers such that $ 1 \le i, j \le 6 $ . The line should be ended with a line break character. After submitting a query, flush the output and read the answer to your query — one line containing one integer $ a_i \cdot a_j $ . If you submit an incorrect query (or ask more than $ 4 $ queries), the answer to it will be one string 0. After receiving such an answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict "Runtime error", "Time limit exceeded" or some other verdict instead of "Wrong answer".
To give the answer, your program should print one line $ ! $ $ a_1 $ $ a_2 $ $ a_3 $ $ a_4 $ $ a_5 $ $ a_6 $ with a line break in the end. After that, it should flush the output and terminate gracefully.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>If you want to submit a hack for this problem, your test should contain exactly six space-separated integers $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_6 $ . Each of $ 6 $ special numbers should occur exactly once in the test. The test should be ended with a line break character.</div>
