<h1>Petr and a calendar</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
PETR这个人想写一个2017年一个月的日期表，日期从上往下，从左往右写。第一行代表周一，第二行代表周二，...，第七行代表周日。如：2017年一月1号是周日，则17年一月的日历写成：
```
2 9 16 23 30
3 10 17 24 31
4 11 18 25
5 12 19 26
6 13 20 27
7 14 21 28
1 8 15 22 29
```
你要求出日历有几列。
# 输入输出
正整数m,d(1<=m<=12,1<=d<=7).
m表示月份，d表示本月第一天是周几。
输出日历有几列。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petr wants to make a calendar for current month. For this purpose he draws a table in which columns correspond to weeks (a week is seven consequent days from Monday to Sunday), rows correspond to weekdays, and cells contain dates. For example, a calendar for January 2017 should look like on the picture:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF760A/70f7bb298739f0018d24699e43e0bdba58d6965c.png)Petr wants to know how many columns his table should have given the month and the weekday of the first date of that month? Assume that the year is non-leap.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contain two integers $ m $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=m<=12 $ , $ 1<=d<=7 $ ) — the number of month (January is the first month, December is the twelfth) and the weekday of the first date of this month ( $ 1 $ is Monday, $ 7 $ is Sunday).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print single integer: the number of columns the table should have.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>1 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>11 6
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The first example corresponds to the January 2017 shown on the picture in the statements.
In the second example $ 1 $ -st January is Monday, so the whole month fits into $ 5 $ columns.
In the third example $ 1 $ -st November is Saturday and $ 5 $ columns is enough.</div>
