<h1>George and Sleep</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>```
输入两个时间s,t(可能是不同天的),求出s-t的差,也用HH:MM形式表示
```</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>George woke up and saw the current time $ s $ on the digital clock. Besides, George knows that he has slept for time $ t $ .
Help George! Write a program that will, given time $ s $ and $ t $ , determine the time $ p $ when George went to bed. Note that George could have gone to bed yesterday relatively to the current time (see the second test sample).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains current time $ s $ as a string in the format "hh:mm". The second line contains time $ t $ in the format "hh:mm" — the duration of George's sleep. It is guaranteed that the input contains the correct time in the 24-hour format, that is, $ 00<=hh<=23 $ , $ 00<=mm<=59 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print time $ p $ — the time George went to bed in the format similar to the format of the time in the input.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>05:50
05:44
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>00:06

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>00:01

</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>00:01
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample George went to bed at "00:06". Note that you should print the time only in the format "00:06". That's why answers "0:06", "00:6" and others will be considered incorrect.
In the second sample, George went to bed yesterday.
In the third sample, George didn't do to bed at all.</div>
