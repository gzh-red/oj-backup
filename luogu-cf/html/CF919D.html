给你一个有向图，每个点有一个小写字母权值
定义一条路径的权值是这条路径出现次数最多的字母的个数
求出这个图权值最大权值的路径的权值。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ directed edges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are "abaca", then the value of that path is $ 3 $ . Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two positive integers $ n,m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=300000 $ ), denoting that the graph has $ n $ nodes and $ m $ directed edges.
The second line contains a string $ s $ with only lowercase English letters. The $ i $ -th character is the letter assigned to the $ i $ -th node.
Then $ m $ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $ x,y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ), describing a directed edge from $ x $ to $ y $ . Note that $ x $ can be equal to $ y $ and there can be multiple edges between $ x $ and $ y $ . Also the graph can be not connected.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the path with largest value is $ 1→3→4→5 $ . The value is $ 3 $ because the letter 'a' appears $ 3 $ times.</div>
