<h1>Producing Snow</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Alice非常喜欢雪！
她每天都会堆一堆$V$ 升的雪，然而每堆雪每天都会融化$T$ 升，当然，要是这堆雪的体积$V<=0$ 时，它就永远消失了。
现在她想知道，$n$ 天中每天融化了多少升雪呢？
输入输出格式
输入格式：
第一行包括一个整数 $n$ ($1<=N<=10^{5}$ ) 表示天数。
第二行包括 $n$ 个整数 $V_{1},V_{2},...,V_{N}$ 表示每天堆的那堆雪的体积。
第三行包括 $n$ 个整数 $T_{1},T_{2},...,T_{N}$ 表示每天每堆雪熔化的体积。
输出格式：
输出一行 每一天雪总共的熔化量（共 $n$ 个整数）。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift — a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day $ i $ he will make a pile of snow of volume $ V_{i} $ and put it in her garden.
Each day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is $ T_{i} $ , each pile will reduce its volume by $ T_{i} $ . If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other.
Note that the pile made on day $ i $ already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.
You are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of days.
The second line contains $ N $ integers $ V_{1},V_{2},...,V_{N} $ ( $ 0<=V_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ V_{i} $ is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day $ i $ .
The third line contains $ N $ integers $ T_{1},T_{2},...,T_{N} $ ( $ 0<=T_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ T_{i} $ is the temperature on the day $ i $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single line with $ N $ integers, where the $ i $ -th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day $ i $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.</div>
