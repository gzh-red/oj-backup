<h1>Array Stabilization</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你`n`个数,现在可以删除一个数,求删除数后数列的$\max\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i$.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array $ a $ consisting of $ n $ integer numbers.
Let instability of the array be the following value: $ \max\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i $ .
You have to remove exactly one element from this array to minimize instability of the resulting $ (n-1) $ -elements array. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of elements in the array $ a $ .
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^5 $ ) — elements of the array $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $ a $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
4
1 3 3 7

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>

1 100000
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
0
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you can remove $ 7 $ then instability of the remaining array will be $ 3 - 1 = 2 $ .
In the second example you can remove either $ 1 $ or $ 100000 $ then instability of the remaining array will be $ 100000 - 100000 = 0 $ and $ 1 - 1 = 0 $ correspondingly.</div>
