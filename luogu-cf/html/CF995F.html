<h1>Cowmpany Cowmpensation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has started a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires $ n-1 $ other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If $ u $ is a superior of $ v $ and $ v $ is a superior of $ w $ then also $ u $ is a superior of $ w $ . Additionally, there are no $ u $ and $ v $ such that $ u $ is the superior of $ v $ and $ v $ is the superior of $ u $ . Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number $ 1 $ , and the others are employee numbers $ 2 $ through $ n $ .
Finally, Allen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself. Due to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between $ 1 $ and $ D $ . Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his superior.
Help Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this number may be large, output it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ D $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3000 $ , $ 1 \le D \le 10^9 $ ).
The remaining $ n-1 $ lines each contain a single positive integer, where the $ i $ -th line contains the integer $ p_i $ ( $ 1 \le p_i \le i $ ). $ p_i $ denotes the direct superior of employee $ i+1 $ .</div>
