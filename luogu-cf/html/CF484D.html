<h1>Kindergarten</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一组数，你要把他分成若干连续段。每一段的值，定义为这一段
数中最大值与最小值的差。
求一种分法，使得这若干段的值的和最大。
N < 1e6, a[i] < 1e9。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In a kindergarten, the children are being divided into groups. The teacher put the children in a line and associated each child with his or her integer charisma value. Each child should go to exactly one group. Each group should be a nonempty segment of consecutive children of a line. A group's sociability is the maximum difference of charisma of two children in the group (in particular, if the group consists of one child, its sociability equals a zero).
The teacher wants to divide the children into some number of groups in such way that the total sociability of the groups is maximum. Help him find this value.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test sample one of the possible variants of an division is following: the first three children form a group with sociability 2, and the two remaining children form a group with sociability 1.
In the second test sample any division leads to the same result, the sociability will be equal to 0 in each group.</div>
