<h1>Sereja and Sets</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja has $ m $ non-empty sets of integers $ A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{m} $ . What a lucky coincidence! The given sets are a partition of the set of all integers from 1 to $ n $ . In other words, for any integer $ v $ $ (1<=v<=n) $ there is exactly one set $ A_{t} $ such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF367D/3f8a940400a40d5f76505a83349ff53839519434.png). Also Sereja has integer $ d $ .
Sereja decided to choose some sets from the sets he has. Let's suppose that $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{k}<=m) $ are indexes of the chosen sets. Then let's define an array of integers $ b $ , sorted in ascending order, as a union of the chosen sets, that is, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF367D/99f78eca4a538d2f0ed7359631dcfed20f0ac14e.png). We'll represent the element with number $ j $ in this array (in ascending order) as $ b_{j} $ . Sereja considers his choice of sets correct, if the following conditions are met:
$ b_{1}<=d; b_{i+1}-b_{i}<=d (1<=i&lt;|b|); n-d+1<=b_{|b|}. $ Sereja wants to know what is the minimum number of sets $ (k) $ that he can choose so that his choice will be correct. Help him with that.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ d $ $ (1<=d<=n<=10^{5},1<=m<=20) $ . The next $ m $ lines contain sets. The first number in the $ i $ -th line is $ s_{i} $ $ (1<=s_{i}<=n) $ . This number denotes the size of the $ i $ -th set. Then the line contains $ s_{i} $ distinct integers from 1 to $ n $ — set $ A_{i} $ .
It is guaranteed that the sets form partition of all integers from 1 to $ n $ .</div>

<div>In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum value $ k $ at the right choice.</div>
