<h1>Sum of Digits</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在看完了最后一部《哈利波特》电影后，小杰拉德也决定练习魔法。
他在他的爸爸的魔法书中找到一个咒语可以把任意的数变成它的各个数位上的数字之和。
杰拉德学会了它之后，找来了一个数 _n_ 。
杰拉德要对这个数施几次咒语，才能把它变成一个一位数？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Having watched the last Harry Potter film, little Gerald also decided to practice magic. He found in his father's magical book a spell that turns any number in the sum of its digits. At the moment Gerald learned that, he came across a number $ n $ . How many times can Gerald put a spell on it until the number becomes one-digit?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the only integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{100000} $ ). It is guaranteed that $ n $ doesn't contain any leading zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of times a number can be replaced by the sum of its digits until it only contains one digit.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>991
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the number already is one-digit — Herald can't cast a spell.
The second test contains number $ 10 $ . After one casting of a spell it becomes $ 1 $ , and here the process is completed. Thus, Gerald can only cast the spell once.
The third test contains number $ 991 $ . As one casts a spell the following transformations take place: $ 991→19→10→1 $ . After three transformations the number becomes one-digit.</div>
