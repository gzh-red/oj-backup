<h1>Board Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Polycarp and Vasiliy love simple logical games. Today they play a game with infinite chessboard and one pawn for each player. Polycarp and Vasiliy move in turns, Polycarp starts. In each turn Polycarp can move his pawn from cell $ (x,y) $ to $ (x-1,y) $ or $ (x,y-1) $ . Vasiliy can move his pawn from $ (x,y) $ to one of cells: $ (x-1,y),(x-1,y-1) $ and $ (x,y-1) $ . Both players are also allowed to skip move.
There are some additional restrictions — a player is forbidden to move his pawn to a cell with negative $ x $ -coordinate or $ y $ -coordinate or to the cell containing opponent's pawn The winner is the first person to reach cell $ (0,0) $ .
You are given the starting coordinates of both pawns. Determine who will win if both of them play optimally well.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers: $ x_{p},y_{p},x_{v},y_{v} $ ( $ 0<=x_{p},y_{p},x_{v},y_{v}<=10^{5}) $ — Polycarp's and Vasiliy's starting coordinates.
It is guaranteed that in the beginning the pawns are in different cells and none of them is in the cell $ (0,0) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
