<h1>Doggo Recoloring</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为 $n$ 的小写字母串。你可以将出现次数大于等于2的字母全部变成另一个小写字母。问你最后能否将该小写字母串的所有字母变成同一个字母。如果可以，输出"Yes",否则输出"No"。
感谢@常暗踏阴 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Panic is rising in the committee for doggo standardization — the puppies of the new brood have been born multi-colored! In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from 'a' to 'z' inclusive.
The committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color.
Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there's only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color $ x $ such that there are currently at least two puppies of color $ x $ and recolor all puppies of the color $ x $ into some arbitrary color $ y $ . Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).
For example, if the number of puppies is $ 7 $ and their colors are represented as the string "abababc", then in one operation Slava can get the results "zbzbzbc", "bbbbbbc", "aaaaaac", "acacacc" and others. However, if the current color sequence is "abababc", then he can't choose $ x $ ='c' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color 'c'.
Help Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava's operations all the puppies should have the same color.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of puppies.
The second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where the $ i $ -th symbol denotes the $ i $ -th puppy's color.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it's possible to recolor all puppies into one color, print "Yes".
Otherwise print "No".
Output the answer without quotation signs.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Slava can perform the following steps:
1. take all puppies of color 'a' (a total of two) and recolor them into 'b';
2. take all puppies of color 'd' (a total of two) and recolor them into 'c';
3. take all puppies of color 'b' (three puppies for now) and recolor them into 'c'.
In the second example it's impossible to recolor any of the puppies.
In the third example all the puppies' colors are the same; thus there's no need to recolor anything.</div>
