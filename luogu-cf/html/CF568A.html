<h1>Primes or Palindromes?</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Rikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!
Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.
Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.
One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: $ π(n) $ — the number of primes no larger than $ n $ , $ rub(n) $ — the number of palindromic numbers no larger than $ n $ . Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.
He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient $ A $ find the maximum $ n $ , such that $ π(n)<=A·rub(n) $ .</div>
