<h1>Jamie and Binary Sequence (changed after round)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>把一个数分解成一些2的ki次方，（i=1,2,3....),可以重复，要求最大的ki要尽可能的小，但是要求字典序最大，不超过k个，输出这些次方数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:
Find $ k $ integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number $ n $ and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one.
To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length $ k $ $ (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k}) $ with ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916B/804a330680fa0a689680c55396d7d651c977b163.png). Give a value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916B/3a6d52e5a86468620a5b59c3452f1e46ca1a5ee4.png) to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum $ y $ value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.
For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line consists of two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{18},1<=k<=10^{5}) $ — the required sum and the length of the sequence.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and $ k $ numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.
It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range $ [-10^{18},10^{18}] $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Sample 1:
$ 2^{3}+2^{3}+2^{2}+2^{1}+2^{0}=8+8+4+2+1=23 $
Answers like $ (3,3,2,0,1) $ or $ (0,1,2,3,3) $ are not lexicographically largest.
Answers like $ (4,1,1,1,0) $ do not have the minimum $ y $ value.
Sample 2:
It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.
Sample 3:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916B/32c976228a27c0f708bbb18d0f890775f96c4e59.png)
Powers of 2:
If $ x>0 $ , then $ 2^{x}=2·2·2·...·2 $ ( $ x $ times).
If $ x=0 $ , then $ 2^{x}=1 $ .
If $ x<0 $ , then ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916B/6fdb1f744a78ad201a27505654584044743d34f7.png).
Lexicographical order:
Given two different sequences of the same length, $ (a_{1},a_{2},...\ ,a_{k}) $ and $ (b_{1},b_{2},...\ ,b_{k}) $ , the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if $ a_{i}<b_{i} $ , for the first $ i $ where $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ differ.</div>
