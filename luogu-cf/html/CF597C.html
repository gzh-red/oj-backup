<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For the given sequence with $ n $ different elements find the number of increasing subsequences with $ k+1 $ elements. It is guaranteed that the answer is not greater than $ 8·10^{18} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contain two integer values $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5},0<=k<=10) $ — the length of sequence and the number of elements in increasing subsequences.
Next $ n $ lines contains one integer $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) each — elements of sequence. All values $ a_{i} $ are different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the answer to the problem.</div>
