<h1>Squares and Segments</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>小索菲亚在四年级。今天，在几何课上，她学到了有关线段和正方形的知识。在回家的路上，她决定在雪中画n个边长为1的正方形。为了简单起见，我们假设Sofia生活在一个平面上，并且只能绘制与坐标轴平行、顶点位于整数点的长度为1的线段。
为了绘制一个段，Sofia进行如下操作。如果她想画一个端点为（x，y）和（x，y+1）垂直段。Sofia会查看是否已经有一个绘制的段，其端点为（x'，y）和（x'，y+1）。如果存在这样的段，那么Sofia将使用旧段作为指导，快速绘制新段。如果没有这样的线段，那么索菲亚就必须用尺子长时间测量一个新的线段。当索菲亚想画一个水平段时，也会发生同样的事情，但现在她才检查是否存在具有相同x，x+1坐标和不同y坐标的段。
例如，如果索菲亚需要画一个1 * 1的正方形，她必须用尺子画两段。
如果索菲亚需要画两个正方形，她必须用尺子画三段。
之后，她可以使用前三个部分作为向导绘制其余四个线段。
索菲亚很着急，所以她想尽量减少用尺子在没有向导的情况下绘制的线段数量。帮她找到这个最小数量。
# 输入格式
小正方形的数量n
# 输出格式
一行，一个整数，表示最小数量</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $ n $ squares in the snow with a side length of $ 1 $ . For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $ 1 $ , parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.
In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $ (x, y) $ and $ (x, y+1) $ . Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $ (x', y) $ and $ (x', y+1) $ for some $ x' $ . If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $ x $ , $ x+1 $ and the differing coordinate $ y $ .
For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1099B/193e3fcbc4091a8b6cb3aa67ae9bf3782b2e9ee1.png)After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:
