<h1>Sereja and Straight Lines</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja placed $ n $ points on a plane. Now Sereja wants to place on the plane two straight lines, intersecting at a right angle, so that one of the straight lines intersect the $ Ox $ axis at an angle of $ 45 $ degrees and the maximum distance from the points to the straight lines were minimum.
In this problem we consider the distance between points $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ equal $ |x_{1}-x_{2}|+|y_{1}-y_{2}| $ . The distance between the point and the straight lines is the minimum distance from the point to some point belonging to one of the lines.
Help Sereja, find the maximum distance from the points to the optimally located straight lines.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ . Next $ n $ lines contain the coordinates of the lines. The $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ x_{i},y_{i} $ $ (|x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a real number — the answer to the problem. Your answer will be considered correct iff its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
