<h1>A Prank</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>JATC和他的朋友长颈鹿目前正在他们的房间里，解决一些问题。长颈鹿在板子上写了一个整数数组$a_1,a_2,… ,a_n$，并且形如$1≤a_1<a_2<⋯<a_n≤10^3$，然后去了卫生间。 JATC决定通过删除数组中的一些连续元素来恶作剧他的朋友。由于他不想让恶作剧太过火。他只会以某种方式擦除，这样长颈鹿仍然可以使用其余元素的信息恢复数组。因为长颈鹿已经创建了数组，他也意识到它是一个递增的数组，并且所有元素都是$[1,10^3 ]$范围内的整数。 JATC想知道他最多能删除可以删除多少个元素。 （题目大意：给你一个大小为$n$的单调上升序列，保证元素范围在$[1,10^3 ]$范围内，求最多可以删除多少个连续的元素，使得这个序列还原后唯一）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $ a_1 $ , $ a_2 $ , ..., $ a_n $ of integers, such that $ 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3 $ , and then went to the bathroom.
JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $ [1, 10^3] $ .
JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3 $ ) — the array written by Giraffe.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.
If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $ 0 $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $ [1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9] $ . As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.
In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $ [998, \_, \_] $ . Because all the elements are less than or equal to $ 1000 $ , the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $ 2 $ elements.
In the third example, JATC can erase the first $ 4 $ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $ 1 $ , Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $ 4 $ elements.</div>
