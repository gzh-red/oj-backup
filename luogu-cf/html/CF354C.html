<h1>Vasya and Beautiful Arrays</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有长度为$n$的正整数数组$a$
定义一个数组的美丽度为这个数组所有元素的最大公约数
现在可以进行一些操作：对于每个元素$a[i]$，可以减一个<=$k$的数(可以是0，减了之后$a[i]$必须非负）
现在需要求出这个数组的最大美丽度
$1\le n\le 3e5$
$1\le k\le 1e6$，
$1\le a[i]\le 1e6 $</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya's got a birthday coming up and his mom decided to give him an array of positive integers $ a $ of length $ n $ .
Vasya thinks that an array's beauty is the greatest common divisor of all its elements. His mom, of course, wants to give him as beautiful an array as possible (with largest possible beauty). Unfortunately, the shop has only one array $ a $ left. On the plus side, the seller said that he could decrease some numbers in the array (no more than by $ k $ for each number).
The seller can obtain array $ b $ from array $ a $ if the following conditions hold: $ b_{i}&gt;0; 0<=a_{i}-b_{i}<=k $ for all $ 1<=i<=n $ .
Help mom find the maximum possible beauty of the array she will give to Vasya (that seller can obtain).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n<=3·10^{5};1<=k<=10^{6}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{6}) $ — array $ a $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print a single number — the maximum possible beauty of the resulting array.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6 1

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample we can obtain the array:
$ 3 6 9 12 12 15 $
In the second sample we can obtain the next array:
$ 7 21 49 14 77 $</div>
