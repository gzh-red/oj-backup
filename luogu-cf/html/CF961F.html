<h1>k-substrings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.
Let's denote $ k $ -substring of $ s $ as a string $ subs_{k}=s_{k}s_{k+1}..s_{n+1-k} $ . Obviously, $ subs_{1}=s $ , and there are exactly ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF961F/a53370bfcdd8093b84a167b7bb5ebbbbde89cfc8.png) such substrings.
Let's call some string $ t $ an odd proper suprefix of a string $ T $ iff the following conditions are met:
- $ |T|>|t| $ ;
- $ |t| $ is an odd number;
- $ t $ is simultaneously a prefix and a suffix of $ T $ .
For evey $ k $ -substring (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF961F/0db45c1fd47a0828e7ef646cf910ebdb4ed26cf3.png)) of $ s $ you have to calculate the maximum length of its odd proper suprefix.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ $ (2<=n<=10^{6}) $ — the length $ s $ .
The second line contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF961F/a53370bfcdd8093b84a167b7bb5ebbbbde89cfc8.png) integers. $ i $ -th of them should be equal to maximum length of an odd proper suprefix of $ i $ -substring of $ s $ (or $ -1 $ , if there is no such string that is an odd proper suprefix of $ i $ -substring).</div>
