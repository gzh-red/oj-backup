<h1>Set subtraction</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a starting set consisting of all integers from 1 to 1000, inclusive. You are also given several sets which need to be subtracted from the starting set (i.e., each number which is in at least one of these sets needs to be removed from the starting set). Each subtracted set is represented as an interval of integers from $ A $ to $ B $ , inclusive. Output the result after all subtractions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer $ N $ ( $ 0<=N<=100 $ ) — the number of intervals to be subtracted. The following $ N $ lines contain pairs of integers $ A $ and $ B $ ( $ 1<=A<=B<=1000 $ ) — lower and upper bounds of the intervals. Intervals can intersect. An interval can consist of a single number.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the result of subtractions in the following format: in one line output first the number of integers in the resulting set and then the integers of the set, sorted in increasing order, separated by single space.</div>
