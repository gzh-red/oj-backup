<h1>Vasya and Polynomial</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$1<=t,a,b<=10^{18}$,求有多少个多项式$P(x)=\sum a_i*x^i(a_i\in N)$满足$P(t)=a,P(a)=b$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function $ P(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x^{1}+...+a_{n}x^{n} $ . Numbers $ a_{i} $ are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer $ n $ is called a degree of a polynomial.
Vasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: "Determine how many polynomials $ P(x) $ exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF493E/7b06cb2e25bf991e4ece3c009304fa0e5ea4f3b3.png), and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF493E/dde9c7b515169e25ed5a1052cd7c5bcde9412e7c.png), where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF493E/9de2146b51b305e9def0e50de5b1876df09306e8.png) and $ b $ are given positive integers"?
Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.</div>
