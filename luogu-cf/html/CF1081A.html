<h1>Definite Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
Chouti正在参加一场编程竞赛，然而，当他ak了之后，他觉得很无聊，于是决定发明一些小游戏。
他搞出了这样一个游戏：
玩家有一个正整数$n$，起初，$n$的值等于$v$。
玩家可以进行下列操作任意次（可以是0次）：
选择一个正整数$x$，使得$x<n$且$x$不是$n$的因子，就用$x$减$n$。 游戏的最终目标是使$n$的值最小。 很快，Chouti就发现这个游戏很简单。你也能虐这个游戏吗？ # 输入输出格式 ## 输入 输入只有一行，包含一个整数$v(1 \leq v \leq 10^9)$，$n$的初值。 ## 输出 输出一个整数，玩家能得到的$n$的最小值。 # 说明 第一个样例中，玩家可以先选择$x=3$，然后$n$就会变成$5$，然后选择$x=4$，$n$就会变成$1$. 然而，第一轮玩家不可以选择$x=2$，因为$2$是$8$的因子。 第二个样例中，由于一开始$n=1$，所以玩家什么都不需要做。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.
He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer $ n $ . Initially the value of $ n $ equals to $ v $ and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $ x $ that $ x<n $ and $ x $ is not a divisor of $ n $ , then subtract $ x $ from $ n $ . The goal of the player is to minimize the value of $ n $ in the end. Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains only one integer in the first line: $ v $ ( $ 1 \le v \le 10^9 $ ), the initial value of $ n $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer, the minimum value of $ n $ the player can get.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
8
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>
1
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>
1
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, the player can choose $ x=3 $ in the first turn, then $ n $ becomes $ 5 $ . He can then choose $ x=4 $ in the second turn to get $ n=1 $ as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However, for example, he cannot choose $ x=2 $ in the first turn because $ 2 $ is a divisor of $ 8 $ .
In the second example, since $ n=1 $ initially, the player can do nothing.</div>
