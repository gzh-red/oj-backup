<h1>HQ9+</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
HQ9+是一种搞笑的编程语言，只有4种指令，都是单个字符的：
"H"输出"Hello, World!"；
"Q"输出这个程序本身的源代码；
"9"输出歌曲"99 Bottles of Beer"的歌词（你可以自己上网搜这首歌）；
"+"增加内部储存中的数值
注意"H"和"Q"指令是区分大小写的，必须使用大写。程序中不属于这些指令的字符请忽略。
给你一个用HQ9+写的程序，问这个程序是否会有任何输出。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入有一行，p是这个HQ9+的程序。字符串p的长度在1和100之间，包括1和100。字符串p中每一个字符的ASCII码在33('!'感叹号)和126('~'波浪)之间，包括33和126。
输出格式：
如果这个程序有输出，输出"YES"，否则输出"NO"。
样例说明
第一个样例中只有一个指令"H"，输出了"Hello, World!"。
第二个样例中没有任何一个字符是这个程序的指令。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:
- "H" prints "Hello, World!",
- "Q" prints the source code of the program itself,
- "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,
- "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.
Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.
You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input will consist of a single line $ p $ which will give a program in HQ9+. String $ p $ will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of $ p $ will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Hi!
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>Codeforces
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first case the program contains only one instruction — "H", which prints "Hello, World!".
In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.</div>
