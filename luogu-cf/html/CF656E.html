<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a complete undirected graph. For each pair of vertices you are given the length of the edge that connects them. Find the shortest paths between each pair of vertices in the graph and return the length of the longest of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ N $ ( $ 3<=N<=10 $ ).
The following $ N $ lines each contain $ N $ space-separated integers. $ j $ th integer in $ i $ th line $ a_{ij} $ is the length of the edge that connects vertices $ i $ and $ j $ . $ a_{ij}=a_{ji} $ , $ a_{ii}=0 $ , $ 1<=a_{ij}<=100 $ for $ i≠j $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the maximum length of the shortest path between any pair of vertices in the graph.</div>
