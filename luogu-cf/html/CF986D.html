<h1>Perfect Encoding</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出$N$,请选出$M$个可以相同的正整数$A_i$,使$\Pi_{i=1}^MA_i\ge N$,且$\sum_{i=1}^MA_i$最小(不一定要最小化M).求出这个最小值.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are working as an analyst in a company working on a new system for big data storage. This system will store $ n $ different objects. Each object should have a unique ID.
To create the system, you choose the parameters of the system — integers $ m \ge 1 $ and $ b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{m} $ . With these parameters an ID of some object in the system is an array of integers $ [a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}] $ where $ 1 \le a_{i} \le b_{i} $ holds for every $ 1 \le i \le m $ .
Developers say that production costs are proportional to $ \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{i} $ . You are asked to choose parameters $ m $ and $ b_{i} $ so that the system will be able to assign unique IDs to $ n $ different objects and production costs are minimized. Note that you don't have to use all available IDs.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line of input there is one positive integer $ n $ . The length of the decimal representation of $ n $ is no greater than $ 1.5 \cdot 10^{6} $ . The integer does not contain leading zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one number — minimal value of $ \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{i} $ .</div>
