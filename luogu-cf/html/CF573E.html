<h1>Bear and Bowling</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个长度为$n$的数列$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$。你需要选择一个子序列$b_1,b_2,\dots,b_m$，其中$m$为子序列长度，可以为0。
你需要最大化$\sum\limits_{i=1}^m i\times b_i$。输出最大的值。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Limak is an old brown bear. He often goes bowling with his friends. Today he feels really good and tries to beat his own record!
For rolling a ball one gets a score — an integer (maybe negative) number of points. Score for $ i $ -th roll is multiplied by $ i $ and scores are summed up. So, for $ k $ rolls with scores $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ , total score is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF573E/dc22606298d977fae92bc67b7a4815c447193831.png). Total score is $ 0 $ if there were no rolls.
Limak made $ n $ rolls and got score $ a_{i} $ for $ i $ -th of them. He wants to maximize his total score and he came up with an interesting idea. He will cancel some rolls, saying that something distracted him or there was a strong wind.
Limak is able to cancel any number of rolls, maybe even all or none of them. Total score is calculated as if there were only non-canceled rolls. Look at the sample tests for clarification. What maximum total score can Limak get?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ |a_{i}|<=10^{7}) $ - scores for Limak's rolls.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the maximum possible total score after choosing rolls to cancel.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
-2 -8 0 5 -3

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In first sample Limak should cancel rolls with scores $ -8 $ and $ -3 $ . Then he is left with three rolls with scores $ -2,0,5 $ . Total score is $ 1·(-2)+2·0+3·5=13 $ .
In second sample Limak should cancel roll with score $ -50 $ . Total score is $ 1·(-10)+2·20+3·(-30)+4·40+5·60=400 $ .</div>
