<h1>The Maximum Subtree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述**
$\rm Soulist$给了您 $n$ 条线段，每条线段用两个端点来描述 $[~l_i,r_i~]~$ ，根据这些线段可以构建一张无向图，其中节点 $i$ 与节点 $i+1$ 有一条边当且仅当线段 $i$ 与线段 $i +1$ 相交
一个大小为$m$的树是"好"的，当且仅当您可以从给定的 $n$ 条线段中选出 $m$ 条使得这 $m$ 条线段所构成的图与此树同构
现在给定您一棵树，希望您求出其最大的"好"的子树
您需要回答$q$组询问
**输入格式**
第一行一个正整数表示$q(1\le q\le 1.5*10^5)$
接下来$q$组询问，每组格式如下：
第一行输出一个正整数$n(1\le n\le 3 * 10^5)$
接下来$n-1$行每行描述此树的一条边
保证$\sum n \le 3 * 10^5$
**输出格式**
对于每组数据输出最大的"好"子树的大小
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Assume that you have $ k $ one-dimensional segments $ s_1, s_2, \dots s_k $ (each segment is denoted by two integers — its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of $ k $ vertexes, and there is an edge between the $ i $ -th and the $ j $ -th vertexes ( $ i \neq j $ ) if and only if the segments $ s_i $ and $ s_j $ intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).
For example, if $ s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18] $ , then the resulting graph is the following:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1238F/5ccebeabf5d6a202b692741f0fad2573638b500c.png)A tree of size $ m $ is good if it is possible to choose $ m $ one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.
You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.
Note that you have to answer $ q $ independent queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4 $ ) — the number of the queries.
The first line of each query contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Each of the next $ n - 1 $ lines contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1 \le x, y \le n $ ) denoting an edge between vertices $ x $ and $ y $ . It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of all $ n $ does not exceed $ 3 \cdot 10^5 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query print one integer — the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree.</div>
