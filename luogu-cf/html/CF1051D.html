<h1>Bicolorings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目大意：**
给定一个$2\times n$的棋盘，可以对上面的格子黑白染色，求染色后棋盘上的联通块的个数正好为$k$的染色方案数
**输入格式：**
一行两个整数$n,k$
**输出格式：**
一个整数，表示方案数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a grid, consisting of $ 2 $ rows and $ n $ columns. Each cell of this grid should be colored either black or white.
Two cells are considered neighbours if they have a common border and share the same color. Two cells $ A $ and $ B $ belong to the same component if they are neighbours, or if there is a neighbour of $ A $ that belongs to the same component with $ B $ .
Let's call some bicoloring beautiful if it has exactly $ k $ components.
Count the number of beautiful bicolorings. The number can be big enough, so print the answer modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 1000 $ , $ 1 \le k \le 2n $ ) — the number of columns in a grid and the number of components required.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of beautiful bicolorings modulo $ 998244353 $ .</div>
