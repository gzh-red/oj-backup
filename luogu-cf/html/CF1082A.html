<h1>Vasya and Book</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
Vasya有一本 $n$ 页的电子书，她每次可以向前或向后翻 $d$ 页（但她不能翻到书外面去）。现在她要从第 $x$ 页翻到第 $y$ 页，求她最少翻的次数。
### 输入格式
输入第一行一个整数 $t$ $(1\le t\le 10^3)$ 表示数据组数。
接下来 $t$ 行，每行 $4$ 个正整数 $n,x,y,d$ .$(1\le n,d \le 10^9,1\le x,y\le n)$.
### 输出格式
输出一个整数表示最少翻页次数，如果翻不到则输出 $-1$.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya is reading a e-book. The file of the book consists of $ n $ pages, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The screen is currently displaying the contents of page $ x $ , and Vasya wants to read the page $ y $ . There are two buttons on the book which allow Vasya to scroll $ d $ pages forwards or backwards (but he cannot scroll outside the book). For example, if the book consists of $ 10 $ pages, and $ d = 3 $ , then from the first page Vasya can scroll to the first or to the fourth page by pressing one of the buttons; from the second page — to the first or to the fifth; from the sixth page — to the third or to the ninth; from the eighth — to the fifth or to the tenth.
Help Vasya to calculate the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to move to page $ y $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^3 $ ) — the number of testcases.
Each testcase is denoted by a line containing four integers $ n $ , $ x $ , $ y $ , $ d $ ( $ 1\le n, d \le 10^9 $ , $ 1 \le x, y \le n $ ) — the number of pages, the starting page, the desired page, and the number of pages scrolled by pressing one button, respectively.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one line for each test.
If Vasya can move from page $ x $ to page $ y $ , print the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to do it. Otherwise print $ -1 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test case the optimal sequence is: $ 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 5 $ .
In the second test case it is possible to get to pages $ 1 $ and $ 5 $ .
In the third test case the optimal sequence is: $ 4 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 19 $ .</div>
