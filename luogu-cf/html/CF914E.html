<h1>Palindromes in a Tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意
给你一颗 n 个顶点的树（连通无环图）。顶点从 1 到 n 编号，并且每个顶点对应一个在‘a’到‘t’的字母。
树上的一条路径是回文是指至少有一个对应字母的排列为回文。
对于每个顶点，输出通过它的回文路径的数量。
注意：从u到v的路径与从v到u的路径视为相同，只计数一次。
输入格式：
第一行包含一个整数n（2<=n<=2*10^5）。
接下来的 n-1 行，每行包含两个整数u和v（1<=u,v<=n,u≠v）表示一条连接u和v的边。保证给出的图是一棵树。
再下一行包含一个n个字符的字符串，第i个字符对应第i个顶点。
输出格式：
输出一行，包含n个整数，第i个数表示经过顶点i的回文路径数量。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree (a connected acyclic undirected graph) of $ n $ vertices. Vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and each vertex is assigned a character from a to t.
A path in the tree is said to be palindromic if at least one permutation of the labels in the path is a palindrome.
For each vertex, output the number of palindromic paths passing through it.
Note: The path from vertex $ u $ to vertex $ v $ is considered to be the same as the path from vertex $ v $ to vertex $ u $ , and this path will be counted only once for each of the vertices it passes through.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The next $ n-1 $ lines each contain two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n,u≠v $ ) denoting an edge connecting vertex $ u $ and vertex $ v $ . It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
The next line contains a string consisting of $ n $ lowercase characters from a to t where the $ i $ -th ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) character is the label of vertex $ i $ in the tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers in a single line, the $ i $ -th of which is the number of palindromic paths passing through vertex $ i $ in the tree.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample case, the following paths are palindromic:
$ 2-3-4 $
$ 2-3-5 $
$ 4-3-5 $
Additionally, all paths containing only one vertex are palindromic. Listed below are a few paths in the first sample that are not palindromic:
$ 1-2-3 $
$ 1-2-3-4 $
$ 1-2-3-5 $</div>
