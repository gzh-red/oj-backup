<h1>Photo Processing</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n个数，让你分组，每组最少m个
规定每组的价值是组里面最大数-最小数
要求使得最大价值最小
n,m<=3*10^5
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Evlampiy has found one more cool application to process photos. However the application has certain limitations.
Each photo $ i $ has a contrast $ v_{i} $ . In order for the processing to be truly of high quality, the application must receive at least $ k $ photos with contrasts which differ as little as possible.
Evlampiy already knows the contrast $ v_{i} $ for each of his $ n $ photos. Now he wants to split the photos into groups, so that each group contains at least $ k $ photos. As a result, each photo must belong to exactly one group.
He considers a processing time of the $ j $ -th group to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $ v_{i} $ in the group. Because of multithreading the processing time of a division into groups is the maximum processing time among all groups.
Split $ n $ photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of the division is the minimum possible, i.e. that the the maximum processing time over all groups as least as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — number of photos and minimum size of a group.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ v_{i} $ is the contrast of the $ i $ -th photo.</div>

<div>Print the minimal processing time of the division into groups.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the photos should be split into 2 groups: $ [40,50] $ and $ [110,120,130] $ . The processing time of the first group is $ 10 $ , and the processing time of the second group is $ 20 $ . Maximum among $ 10 $ and $ 20 $ is $ 20 $ . It is impossible to split the photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of division is less than $ 20 $ .
In the second example the photos should be split into four groups, each containing one photo. So the minimal possible processing time of a division is $ 0 $ .</div>
