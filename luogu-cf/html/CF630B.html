<h1>Moore&#039;s Law</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你养了一只史莱姆，这只史莱姆每秒膨胀1.000000011倍。现在给出史莱姆的初始体积n和时间t，求t秒后史莱姆有多大（1000<=n<=10000，0<=t<=2*$10^{9}$），答案精确到小数点后6位</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The city administration of IT City decided to fix up a symbol of scientific and technical progress in the city's main square, namely an indicator board that shows the effect of Moore's law in real time.
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every $ 24 $ months. The implication of Moore's law is that computer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well.
You are to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly $ 1.000000011 $ times.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains a pair of integers $ n $ ( $ 1000<=n<=10 000 $ ) and $ t $ ( $ 0<=t<=2 000 000 000 $ ) — the number of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed since the initial time.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one number — the estimate of the number of transistors in a dence integrated circuit in $ t $ seconds since the initial time. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than $ 10^{-6} $ .</div>
