<h1>Rebus</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a rebus of form ? + ? - ? + ? = n, consisting of only question marks, separated by arithmetic operation '+' and '-', equality and positive integer $ n $ . The goal is to replace each question mark with some positive integer from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , such that equality holds.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains a rebus. It's guaranteed that it contains no more than $ 100 $ question marks, integer $ n $ is positive and doesn't exceed $ 1000000 $ , all letters and integers are separated by spaces, arithmetic operations are located only between question marks.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the output should contain "Possible" (without quotes) if rebus has a solution and "Impossible" (without quotes) otherwise.
If the answer exists, the second line should contain any valid rebus with question marks replaced by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Follow the format given in the samples.</div>
