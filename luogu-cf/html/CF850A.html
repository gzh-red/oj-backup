<h1>Five Dimensional Points</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你五维空间中的 $n$ 个点. 这些点被从 $1$ 到 $n$ 标号. 没有两点重合.
定义一个点 $A$ 是坏的, 当且仅当存在另外两个不同的点 $B$ 和 $C$, 使得向量 $AB$ 和向量 $AC$ 的夹角是锐角. 否则, 这个点 $A$ 就是好的.
输出这n个点中,哪些点是好的.
可以通过点积判断向量的夹角.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given set of $ n $ points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . No two points coincide.
We will call point $ a $ bad if there are different points $ b $ and $ c $ , not equal to $ a $ , from the given set such that angle between vectors ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/0653dbc57091409c95cbdb75a14170af617d0442.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/bde2e95036e34134c1ea6bd6b9709d7dd49d1b09.png) is acute (i.e. strictly less than ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/fe3c8011bb9ee15abb5ac0ee9f2f980eef59656c.png)). Otherwise, the point is called good.
The angle between vectors ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/5a3a683029365387cf086e592ebfccb0e126e88a.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/2c10c8fe0b4dfc279c1514830bc9fce0b1aa6b49.png) in 5-dimensional space is defined as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/d27dbfc0849680d0f326c5cde0af47140b2f6df3.png), where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/0fea22328d6b3b4c1d11529ba4c9764cafce84d3.png) is the scalar product and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/f06b81b731bd497af38154f7447638a84ce787f2.png) is length of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/5a3a683029365387cf086e592ebfccb0e126e88a.png).
Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ) — the number of points.
The next $ n $ lines of input contain five integers $ a_{i},b_{i},c_{i},d_{i},e_{i} $ ( $ |a_{i}|,|b_{i}|,|c_{i}|,|d_{i}|,|e_{i}|<=10^{3} $ ) — the coordinates of the i-th point. All points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First, print a single integer $ k $ — the number of good points.
Then, print $ k $ integers, each on their own line — the indices of the good points in ascending order.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, the first point forms exactly a ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/fe3c8011bb9ee15abb5ac0ee9f2f980eef59656c.png) angle with all other pairs of points, so it is good.
In the second sample, along the cd plane, we can see the points look as follows:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF850A/dc25f4e169ea69409034b12812dd7f4f82002152.png)
We can see that all angles here are acute, so no points are good.</div>
