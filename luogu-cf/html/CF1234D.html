<h1>Distinct Characters Queries</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个字符串s，和q个操作（包括以下两个）
- 1 pos c 将s[pos]上的字符变为c
- 2 l r 输出[l,r]中有多少个不同的字符</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters and $ q $ queries for this string.
Recall that the substring $ s[l; r] $ of the string $ s $ is the string $ s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r $ . For example, the substrings of "codeforces" are "code", "force", "f", "for", but not "coder" and "top".
There are two types of queries:
- $ 1~ pos~ c $ ( $ 1 \le pos \le |s| $ , $ c $ is lowercase Latin letter): replace $ s_{pos} $ with $ c $ (set $ s_{pos} := c $ );
- $ 2~ l~ r $ ( $ 1 \le l \le r \le |s| $ ): calculate the number of distinct characters in the substring $ s[l; r] $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one string $ s $ consisting of no more than $ 10^5 $ lowercase Latin letters.
The second line of the input contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 10^5 $ ) — the number of queries.
The next $ q $ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is given in the format described in the problem statement. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of the second type print the answer for it — the number of distinct characters in the required substring in this query.</div>
