<h1>Big Number and Remainder</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Stepan has a very big positive integer.
Let's consider all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer (if we look at his integer like at a string) which are also integers (i.e. they do not have leading zeros). Let's call such shifts as good shifts. For example, for the integer $ 10203 $ the good shifts are the integer itself $ 10203 $ and integers $ 20310 $ and $ 31020 $ .
Stepan wants to know the minimum remainder of the division by the given number $ m $ among all good shifts. Your task is to determine the minimum remainder of the division by $ m $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the integer which Stepan has. The length of Stepan's integer is between $ 2 $ and $ 200000 $ digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros.
The second line contains the integer $ m $ ( $ 2<=m<=10^{8} $ ) — the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum remainder which Stepan can get if he divides all good shifts of his integer by the given number $ m $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example all good shifts of the integer $ 521 $ (good shifts are equal to $ 521 $ , $ 215 $ and $ 152 $ ) has same remainder $ 2 $ when dividing by $ 3 $ .
In the second example there are only two good shifts: the Stepan's integer itself and the shift by one position to the right. The integer itself is $ 1001 $ and the remainder after dividing it by $ 5 $ equals $ 1 $ . The shift by one position to the right equals to $ 1100 $ and the remainder after dividing it by $ 5 $ equals $ 0 $ , which is the minimum possible remainder.</div>
