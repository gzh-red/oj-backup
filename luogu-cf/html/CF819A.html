<h1>Mister B and Boring Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sometimes Mister B has free evenings when he doesn't know what to do. Fortunately, Mister B found a new game, where the player can play against aliens.
All characters in this game are lowercase English letters. There are two players: Mister B and his competitor.
Initially the players have a string $ s $ consisting of the first $ a $ English letters in alphabetical order (for example, if $ a=5 $ , then $ s $ equals to "abcde").
The players take turns appending letters to string $ s $ . Mister B moves first.
Mister B must append exactly $ b $ letters on each his move. He can arbitrary choose these letters. His opponent adds exactly $ a $ letters on each move.
Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm. The computer on each turn considers the suffix of string $ s $ of length $ a $ and generates a string $ t $ of length $ a $ such that all letters in the string $ t $ are distinct and don't appear in the considered suffix. From multiple variants of $ t $ lexicographically minimal is chosen (if $ a=4 $ and the suffix is "bfdd", the computer chooses string $ t $ equal to "aceg"). After that the chosen string $ t $ is appended to the end of $ s $ .
Mister B soon found the game boring and came up with the following question: what can be the minimum possible number of different letters in string $ s $ on the segment between positions $ l $ and $ r $ , inclusive. Letters of string $ s $ are numerated starting from $ 1 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First and only line contains four space-separated integers: $ a $ , $ b $ , $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=a,b<=12 $ , $ 1<=l<=r<=10^{9} $ ) — the numbers of letters each player appends and the bounds of the segment.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum possible number of different letters in the segment from position $ l $ to position $ r $ , inclusive, in string $ s $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test one of optimal strategies generate string $ s= $ "abababab...", that's why answer is $ 2 $ .
In the second sample test string $ s= $ "abcdbcaefg..." can be obtained, chosen segment will look like "bcdbc", that's why answer is $ 3 $ .
In the third sample test string $ s= $ "abczzzacad..." can be obtained, chosen, segment will look like "zzz", that's why answer is $ 1 $ .</div>
