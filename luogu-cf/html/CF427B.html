<h1>Prison Transfer</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你所在城市的监狱里有囚犯。 由于监狱无法容纳所有人，市长决定将c c囚犯转移到另一个城市的监狱。
出于这个原因，他让n名囚犯站在一条线上，胸前写着一个号码。 这个数字是他/她犯下的罪行的严重程度。 数字越大，他/她的犯罪就越严重。
然后，市长告诉你选择c个囚犯，他们将被转移到另一个监狱。 他还施加了两个条件。
选定的c个囚犯必须是一个连续的部分。
任何选定的囚犯犯罪水平不应高于t。 因为，这将使囚犯成为一个严重的罪犯，市长不想冒转移期间逃跑的风险。
找出可以选择c囚犯的方式数量。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The prison of your city has $ n $ prisoners. As the prison can't accommodate all of them, the city mayor has decided to transfer $ c $ of the prisoners to a prison located in another city.
For this reason, he made the $ n $ prisoners to stand in a line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of the crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe his/her crime was.
Then, the mayor told you to choose the $ c $ prisoners, who will be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They are,
- The chosen $ c $ prisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners.
- Any of the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater then $ t $ . Because, that will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to take the risk of his running away during the transfer.
Find the number of ways you can choose the $ c $ prisoners.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will contain three space separated integers $ n (1<=n<=2·10^{5}) $ , $ t (0<=t<=10^{9}) $ and $ c (1<=c<=n) $ . The next line will contain $ n $ space separated integers, the $ i^{th} $ integer is the severity $ i^{th} $ prisoner's crime. The value of crime severities will be non-negative and will not exceed $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the number of ways you can choose the $ c $ prisoners.</div>
