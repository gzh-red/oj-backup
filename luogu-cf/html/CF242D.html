<h1>Dispute</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Valera has $ n $ counters numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Some of them are connected by wires, and each of the counters has a special button.
Initially, all the counters contain number $ 0 $ . When you press a button on a certain counter, the value it has increases by one. Also, the values recorded in all the counters, directly connected to it by a wire, increase by one.
Valera and Ignat started having a dispute, the dispute is as follows. Ignat thought of a sequence of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Valera should choose some set of distinct counters and press buttons on each of them exactly once (on other counters the buttons won't be pressed). If after that there is a counter with the number $ i $ , which has value $ a_{i} $ , then Valera loses the dispute, otherwise he wins the dispute.
Help Valera to determine on which counters he needs to press a button to win the dispute.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5}) $ , that denote the number of counters Valera has and the number of pairs of counters connected by wires.
Each of the following $ m $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ $ (1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}≠v_{i}) $ , that mean that counters with numbers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ are connected by a wire. It is guaranteed that each pair of connected counters occurs exactly once in the input.
The last line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (0<=a_{i}<=10^{5}) $ , where $ a_{i} $ is the value that Ignat choose for the $ i $ -th counter.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Valera can't win the dispute print in the first line -1.
Otherwise, print in the first line integer $ k $ $ (0<=k<=n) $ . In the second line print $ k $ distinct space-separated integers — the numbers of the counters, where Valera should push buttons to win the dispute, in arbitrary order.
If there exists multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
