<h1>Unusual Sequences</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入x,y，求有多少个数列满足其gcd为x，和为y。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Count the number of distinct sequences $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i} $ ) consisting of positive integers such that $ gcd(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})=x $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF900D/b6b0405f12ef386aeb195f818cd0534bcf4623e0.png). As this number could be large, print the answer modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
$ gcd $ here means the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two positive integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of such sequences modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
