<h1>Pangram</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>如果一个字符串包含了所有的字符（a到z，不区分大小写），那么我们就说这是一个神奇的字符串。
现在，给你一个由大写和小写字母组成的字符串，判断其是否为神奇的字符串。
第一行包含一个整数n（1≤n≤100）表示字符串的长度。
第二行包含字符串，该字符串只包含大写和小写字母。
如果是神奇的字符串，就输出YES，否则输出NO。
By @馒头精 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A word or a sentence in some language is called a pangram if all the characters of the alphabet of this language appear in it at least once. Pangrams are often used to demonstrate fonts in printing or test the output devices.
You are given a string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Check whether this string is a pangram. We say that the string contains a letter of the Latin alphabet if this letter occurs in the string in uppercase or lowercase.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of characters in the string.
The second line contains the string. The string consists only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES", if the string is a pangram and "NO" otherwise.</div>
