<h1>The Phone Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number!
The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of $ n $ can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.
The sequence of $ n $ integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ exactly once.
The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS).
A subsequence $ a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_k} $ where $ 1\leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k\leq n $ is called increasing if $ a_{i_1} < a_{i_2} < a_{i_3} < \ldots < a_{i_k} $ . If $ a_{i_1} > a_{i_2} > a_{i_3} > \ldots > a_{i_k} $ , a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.
For example, if there is a permutation $ [6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5] $ , LIS of this permutation will be $ [1, 2, 3, 5] $ , so the length of LIS is equal to $ 4 $ . LDS can be $ [6, 4, 1] $ , $ [6, 4, 2] $ , or $ [6, 4, 3] $ , so the length of LDS is $ 3 $ .
Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.
So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<br />
<div>The only line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the length of permutation that you need to build.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, you can build a permutation $ [3, 4, 1, 2] $ . LIS is $ [3, 4] $ (or $ [1, 2] $ ), so the length of LIS is equal to $ 2 $ . LDS can be ony of $ [3, 1] $ , $ [4, 2] $ , $ [3, 2] $ , or $ [4, 1] $ . The length of LDS is also equal to $ 2 $ . The sum is equal to $ 4 $ . Note that $ [3, 4, 1, 2] $ is not the only permutation that is valid.
In the second sample, you can build a permutation $ [2, 1] $ . LIS is $ [1] $ (or $ [2] $ ), so the length of LIS is equal to $ 1 $ . LDS is $ [2, 1] $ , so the length of LDS is equal to $ 2 $ . The sum is equal to $ 3 $ . Note that permutation $ [1, 2] $ is also valid.</div>
