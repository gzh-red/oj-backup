<h1>Complete the Projects (easy version)</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/pic/72108.png)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The only difference between easy and hard versions is that you should complete all the projects in easy version but this is not necessary in hard version.
Polycarp is a very famous freelancer. His current rating is $ r $ units.
Some very rich customers asked him to complete some projects for their companies. To complete the $ i $ -th project, Polycarp needs to have at least $ a_i $ units of rating; after he completes this project, his rating will change by $ b_i $ (his rating will increase or decrease by $ b_i $ ) ( $ b_i $ can be positive or negative). Polycarp's rating should not fall below zero because then people won't trust such a low rated freelancer.
Is it possible to complete all the projects? Formally, write a program to check if such an order of the projects exists, that Polycarp has enough rating before starting each project, and he has non-negative rating after completing each project.
In other words, you have to check that there exists such an order of projects in which Polycarp will complete them, so he has enough rating before starting each project, and has non-negative rating after completing each project.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ r $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le r \le 30000 $ ) — the number of projects and the initial rating of Polycarp, respectively.
The next $ n $ lines contain projects, one per line. The $ i $ -th project is represented as a pair of integers $ a_i $ and $ b_i $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 30000 $ , $ -300 \le b_i \le 300 $ ) — the rating required to complete the $ i $ -th project and the rating change after the project completion.</div>
