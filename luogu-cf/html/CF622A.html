<h1>Infinite Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在有一串数列 1 1,2 1,2,3 1,2,3,4 1,2,3,4,5 1,2,3,4,5,6 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 等等
现在给你一个n 1<=n<=10^14 求出第n个数
感谢@Zealot 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider the infinite sequence of integers: $ 1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5... $ . The sequence is built in the following way: at first the number $ 1 $ is written out, then the numbers from $ 1 $ to $ 2 $ , then the numbers from $ 1 $ to $ 3 $ , then the numbers from $ 1 $ to $ 4 $ and so on. Note that the sequence contains numbers, not digits. For example number $ 10 $ first appears in the sequence in position $ 55 $ (the elements are numerated from one).
Find the number on the $ n $ -th position of the sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{14} $ ) — the position of the number to find.
Note that the given number is too large, so you should use $ 64 $ -bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the element in the $ n $ -th position of the sequence (the elements are numerated from one).</div>
