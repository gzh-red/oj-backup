<h1>Whose sentence is it?</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一天，liouzhou_101得到了Freda和Rainbow的聊天记录。出于好奇，他想知道那些话是Freda说的，那些是Rainbow说的。已知Freda说的话以“lala”结尾,而Rainbow说的话以“miao”结尾。现在给你句子，请你告诉liouzhou_101这些句子分别是谁说的。
如果不知道，输出"OMG>.< I don't know!"</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day, liouzhou\_101 got a chat record of Freda and Rainbow. Out of curiosity, he wanted to know which sentences were said by Freda, and which were said by Rainbow. According to his experience, he thought that Freda always said "lala." at the end of her sentences, while Rainbow always said "miao." at the beginning of his sentences. For each sentence in the chat record, help liouzhou\_101 find whose sentence it is.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10 $ ), number of sentences in the chat record. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a sentence. A sentence is a string that contains only Latin letters (A-Z, a-z), underline (\_), comma (,), point (.) and space ( ). Its length doesn’t exceed 100.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each sentence, output "Freda's" if the sentence was said by Freda, "Rainbow's" if the sentence was said by Rainbow, or "OMG>.< I don't know!" if liouzhou\_101 can’t recognize whose sentence it is. He can’t recognize a sentence if it begins with "miao." and ends with "lala.", or satisfies neither of the conditions.</div>
