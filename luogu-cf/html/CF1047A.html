三个正整数$a,b,c$，输出任意一组即可</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little C loves number «3» very much. He loves all things about it.
Now he has a positive integer $ n $ . He wants to split $ n $ into $ 3 $ positive integers $ a,b,c $ , such that $ a+b+c=n $ and none of the $ 3 $ integers is a multiple of $ 3 $ . Help him to find a solution.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line containing one integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \leq n \leq 10^9 $ ) — the integer Little C has.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
