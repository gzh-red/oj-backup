<h1>Initial Bet</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有五个人在玩游戏
每个人一开始有b个硬币
有一种操作是把一个硬币给另一个人
给你所有人经过若干次操作的硬币数
求b，若无解输出-1</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are five people playing a game called "Generosity". Each person gives some non-zero number of coins $ b $ as an initial bet. After all players make their bets of $ b $ coins, the following operation is repeated for several times: a coin is passed from one player to some other player.
Your task is to write a program that can, given the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, determine the size $ b $ of the initial bet or find out that such outcome of the game cannot be obtained for any positive number of coins $ b $ in the initial bet.</div>
