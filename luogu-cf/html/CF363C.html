<h1>Fixing Typos</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Many modern text editors automatically check the spelling of the user's text. Some editors even suggest how to correct typos.
In this problem your task to implement a small functionality to correct two types of typos in a word. We will assume that three identical letters together is a typo (for example, word "helllo" contains a typo). Besides, a couple of identical letters immediately followed by another couple of identical letters is a typo too (for example, words "helloo" and "wwaatt" contain typos).
Write a code that deletes the minimum number of letters from a word, correcting described typos in the word. You are allowed to delete letters from both ends and from the middle of the word.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line of the input contains word $ s $ , its length is from 1 to 200000 characters. The given word $ s $ consists of lowercase English letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print such word $ t $ that it doesn't contain any typos described in the problem statement and is obtained from $ s $ by deleting the least number of letters.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>helloo
</code></pre>
