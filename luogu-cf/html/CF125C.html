<h1>Hobbits&#039; Party</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everyone knows that hobbits love to organize all sorts of parties and celebrations. There are $ n $ hobbits living in the Shire. They decided to organize the Greatest Party (GP) that would last for several days. Next day the hobbits wrote a guest list, some non-empty set containing all the inhabitants of the Shire. To ensure that everybody enjoy themselves and nobody gets bored, for any two days (say, days A and B) of the GP there existed at least one hobbit, invited to come on day A and on day B. However, to ensure that nobody has a row, for any three different days A, B, C there shouldn't be a hobbit invited on days A, B and C. The Shire inhabitants are keen on keeping the GP going for as long as possible. Your task is given number $ n $ , to indicate the GP's maximum duration and the guest lists for each day.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=10000 $ ), representing the number of hobbits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first output line print a number $ k $ — the maximum duration of GP in days. Then on $ k $ lines print the guest lists, (the guests should be separated by spaces). Print each guest list on the single line. Each list can contain an arbitrary positive number of hobbits. The hobbits are numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .</div>
