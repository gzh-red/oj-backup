<h1>Mike and Fax</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>While Mike was walking in the subway, all the stuff in his back-bag dropped on the ground. There were several fax messages among them. He concatenated these strings in some order and now he has string $ s $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF548A/8e6eb6a5966077211062d31ebdd4df5e9f389a77.png)He is not sure if this is his own back-bag or someone else's. He remembered that there were exactly $ k $ messages in his own bag, each was a palindrome string and all those strings had the same length.
He asked you to help him and tell him if he has worn his own back-bag. Check if the given string $ s $ is a concatenation of $ k $ palindromes of the same length.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains string $ s $ containing lowercase English letters ( $ 1<=|s|<=1000 $ ).
The second line contains integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=1000 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES"(without quotes) if he has worn his own back-bag or "NO"(without quotes) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Palindrome is a string reading the same forward and backward.
In the second sample, the faxes in his back-bag can be "saddas" and "tavvat".</div>
