<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan Anatolyevich's agency is starting to become famous in the town.
They have already ordered and made $ n $ TV commercial videos. Each video is made in a special way: the colors and the soundtrack are adjusted to the time of the day and the viewers' mood. That's why the $ i $ -th video can only be shown within the time range of $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ (it is not necessary to use the whole segment but the broadcast time should be within this segment).
Now it's time to choose a TV channel to broadcast the commercial. Overall, there are $ m $ TV channels broadcasting in the city, the $ j $ -th one has $ c_{j} $ viewers, and is ready to sell time $ [a_{j},b_{j}] $ to broadcast the commercial.
Ivan Anatolyevich is facing a hard choice: he has to choose exactly one video $ i $ and exactly one TV channel $ j $ to broadcast this video and also a time range to broadcast $ [x,y] $ . At that the time range should be chosen so that it is both within range $ [l_{i},r_{i}] $ and within range $ [a_{j},b_{j}] $ .
Let's define the efficiency of the broadcast as value $ (y-x)·c_{j} $ — the total sum of time that all the viewers of the TV channel are going to spend watching the commercial. Help Ivan Anatolyevich choose the broadcast with the maximum efficiency!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of commercial videos and channels, respectively.
Each of the following $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ ( $ 0<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the segment of time when it is possible to show the corresponding video.
Each of the following $ m $ lines contains three integers $ a_{j} $ , $ b_{j} $ , $ c_{j} $ ( $ 0<=a_{j}<=b_{j}<=10^{9} $ , $ 1<=c_{j}<=10^{9} $ ), characterizing the TV channel.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print an integer — the maximum possible efficiency of the broadcast. If there is no correct way to get a strictly positive efficiency, print a zero.
If the maximum efficiency is strictly positive, in the second line also print the number of the video $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) and the number of the TV channel $ j $ ( $ 1<=j<=m $ ) in the most effective broadcast.
If there are multiple optimal answers, you can print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample test the most optimal solution is to show the second commercial using the first TV channel at time $ [2,4] $ . The efficiency of such solution is equal to $ (4-2)·2=4 $ .
In the second sample test Ivan Anatolievich's wish does not meet the options of the TV channel, the segments do not intersect, so the answer is zero.</div>
