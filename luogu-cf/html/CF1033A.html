<h1>King Escape</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述：
艾丽丝和鲍勃正在一个n*n大棋盘上下棋。爱丽丝只剩下一个皇后，位于(a_x，a_y)，而鲍勃只有一个国王，位于(b_x，b_y)。爱丽丝认为，她的皇后是主宰棋盘的，所以胜利是属于她的。但是鲍勃已经制定了一个计划来赢得胜利，他需要移动国王到(c_x，c_y)，以便为自己争取胜利。当爱丽丝被她的自信所分心时，她将不会移动他的皇后，只有鲍勃才能进行移动。如果鲍勃能把他的国王从(b_x，b_y)移到(c_x，c_y)，他就会赢。请记住，国王可以移动到任何8个相邻的棋格。如果国王与皇后处于同一行、同一列或同一对角线，则将所到攻击。看看鲍勃能不能赢。
## 输入格式：
第一行：一个数:棋盘的行数和列数n（3<=n<=1000）
第二行：两个数:a_x,a_y（1<=a_x,a_y<=n）
第三行：两个数:b_x,b_y（1<=b_x,b_y<=n）
第四行：两个数:c_x,c_y（1<=c_x,c_y<=n）
## 输出格式：
能赢输出"YES",否则输出"NO"
### （样例解析请看图）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice and Bob are playing chess on a huge chessboard with dimensions $ n \times n $ . Alice has a single piece left — a queen, located at $ (a_x, a_y) $ , while Bob has only the king standing at $ (b_x, b_y) $ . Alice thinks that as her queen is dominating the chessboard, victory is hers.
But Bob has made a devious plan to seize the victory for himself — he needs to march his king to $ (c_x, c_y) $ in order to claim the victory for himself. As Alice is distracted by her sense of superiority, she no longer moves any pieces around, and it is only Bob who makes any turns.
Bob will win if he can move his king from $ (b_x, b_y) $ to $ (c_x, c_y) $ without ever getting in check. Remember that a king can move to any of the $ 8 $ adjacent squares. A king is in check if it is on the same rank (i.e. row), file (i.e. column), or diagonal as the enemy queen.
Find whether Bob can win or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3 \leq n \leq 1000 $ ) — the dimensions of the chessboard.
The second line contains two integers $ a_x $ and $ a_y $ ( $ 1 \leq a_x, a_y \leq n $ ) — the coordinates of Alice's queen.
The third line contains two integers $ b_x $ and $ b_y $ ( $ 1 \leq b_x, b_y \leq n $ ) — the coordinates of Bob's king.
The fourth line contains two integers $ c_x $ and $ c_y $ ( $ 1 \leq c_x, c_y \leq n $ ) — the coordinates of the location that Bob wants to get to.
It is guaranteed that Bob's king is currently not in check and the target location is not in check either.
Furthermore, the king is not located on the same square as the queen (i.e. $ a_x \neq b_x $ or $ a_y \neq b_y $ ), and the target does coincide neither with the queen's position (i.e. $ c_x \neq a_x $ or $ c_y \neq a_y $ ) nor with the king's position (i.e. $ c_x \neq b_x $ or $ c_y \neq b_y $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" (without quotes) if Bob can get from $ (b_x, b_y) $ to $ (c_x, c_y) $ without ever getting in check, otherwise print "NO".
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the diagrams below, the squares controlled by the black queen are marked red, and the target square is marked blue.
In the first case, the king can move, for instance, via the squares $ (2, 3) $ and $ (3, 2) $ . Note that the direct route through $ (2, 2) $ goes through check.
