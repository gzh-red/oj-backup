<h1>Superhero Battle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;超级英雄与怪物搏斗。这场战斗由几轮组成，每轮持续时间正好是 n 分钟。一轮结束后，下一轮马上开始。这是一次又一次的重复。
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;每一轮都是相同的攻击方式。它由 n 个数字描述：d1 , d2 ,…,dn（−10^6 ≤ di ≤ 10^6）。第 i 个数意味着怪物的生命值在每轮的第 i 分钟变化 di 值。也就是说，如果在第 i 分钟之前怪物的生命值是 h，那么在第 i 分钟之后它会变为 h+di。
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;怪物的初始生命值是 H 。输出怪物哪一分钟死亡。如果怪物的生命值小于或等于0，怪物就会死亡。如果战斗无限持续，则输出-1。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A superhero fights with a monster. The battle consists of rounds, each of which lasts exactly $ n $ minutes. After a round ends, the next round starts immediately. This is repeated over and over again.
Each round has the same scenario. It is described by a sequence of $ n $ numbers: $ d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n $ ( $ -10^6 \le d_i \le 10^6 $ ). The $ i $ -th element means that monster's hp (hit points) changes by the value $ d_i $ during the $ i $ -th minute of each round. Formally, if before the $ i $ -th minute of a round the monster's hp is $ h $ , then after the $ i $ -th minute it changes to $ h := h + d_i $ .
The monster's initial hp is $ H $ . It means that before the battle the monster has $ H $ hit points. Print the first minute after which the monster dies. The monster dies if its hp is less than or equal to $ 0 $ . Print -1 if the battle continues infinitely.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ H $ and $ n $ ( $ 1 \le H \le 10^{12} $ , $ 1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5 $ ). The second line contains the sequence of integers $ d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n $ ( $ -10^6 \le d_i \le 10^6 $ ), where $ d_i $ is the value to change monster's hp in the $ i $ -th minute of a round.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print -1 if the superhero can't kill the monster and the battle will last infinitely. Otherwise, print the positive integer $ k $ such that $ k $ is the first minute after which the monster is dead.</div>
