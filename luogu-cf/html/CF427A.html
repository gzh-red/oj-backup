<h1>Police Recruits</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你有一个银行账户，现在账户里没有一分钱。
有一天，你接到的银行发来的~~抢钱~~征税报告，由于你的卡里透支了，你只能往里面充值，但是，充值并不能补回你原来透支的钱，只能对付后来的征税，求你最后透支了多少钱。
$by$ TRZ_2007</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The police department of your city has just started its journey. Initially, they don’t have any manpower. So, they started hiring new recruits in groups.
Meanwhile, crimes keeps occurring within the city. One member of the police force can investigate only one crime during his/her lifetime.
If there is no police officer free (isn't busy with crime) during the occurrence of a crime, it will go untreated.
Given the chronological order of crime occurrences and recruit hirings, find the number of crimes which will go untreated.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will contain an integer $ n (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ , the number of events. The next line will contain $ n $ space-separated integers.
If the integer is -1 then it means a crime has occurred. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time. No more than 10 officers will be recruited at a time.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, the number of crimes which will go untreated.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>8
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Lets consider the second example:
1. Firstly one person is hired.
2. Then crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.
3. One more person is hired.
4. One more crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.
5. Crime appears. There is no free policeman at the time, so this crime will go untreated.
6. One more person is hired.
7. One more person is hired.
8. One more person is hired.
The answer is one, as one crime (on step 5) will go untreated.</div>
