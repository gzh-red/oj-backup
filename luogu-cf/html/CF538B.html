<h1>Quasi Binary</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目描述**
给出一个数n，你需要将n写成若干个数的和，其中每个数的十进制表示中仅包含0和1。
问最少需要多少个数
**输入输出格式**
输入格式：
一行 一个数 n（1≤n≤10^6）
输出格式：
最少的数的个数，并给出一种方案。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A number is called quasibinary if its decimal representation contains only digits 0 or 1. For example, numbers 0, 1, 101, 110011 — are quasibinary and numbers 2, 12, 900 are not.
You are given a positive integer $ n $ . Represent it as a sum of minimum number of quasibinary numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print a single integer $ k $ — the minimum number of numbers in the representation of number $ n $ as a sum of quasibinary numbers.
In the second line print $ k $ numbers — the elements of the sum. All these numbers should be quasibinary according to the definition above, their sum should equal $ n $ . Do not have to print the leading zeroes in the numbers. The order of numbers doesn't matter. If there are multiple possible representations, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
