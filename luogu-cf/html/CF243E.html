<h1>Matrix</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个n*n的01矩阵，问能否交换矩阵中各列，使得每一行的1全部连续，如果可以，输出YES，然后输出交换后任意一个可能的结果，否则，输出NO</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's consider an $ n×n $ square matrix, consisting of digits one and zero.
We'll consider a matrix good, if it meets the following condition: in each row of the matrix all ones go in one group. That is, each row of the matrix looks like that $ 00...0011...1100...00 $ (or simply consists of zeroes if it has no ones).
You are given matrix $ a $ of size $ n×n $ , consisting of zeroes and ones. Your task is to determine whether you can get a good matrix $ b $ from it by rearranging the columns or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=500 $ ) — the size of matrix $ a $ .
Each of $ n $ following lines contains $ n $ characters "0" and "1" — matrix $ a $ . Note that the characters are written without separators.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" in the first line, if you can rearrange the matrix columns so as to get a good matrix $ b $ . In the next $ n $ lines print the good matrix $ b $ . If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
If it is impossible to get a good matrix, print "NO".</div>
