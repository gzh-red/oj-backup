<h1>Vasya and Isolated Vertices</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>定义无向图上“被孤立的”节点为和其他节点之间都没有连边的节点。
现在已知图上有$n$个点，$m$条边。你可以以以任何方式连边的方式来构造这个图，但是必须保证没有重边和自环出现。
问图中“被孤立的”节点的可能的最小值和最大值。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has got an undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. This graph doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges. Self-loop is an edge connecting a vertex to itself. Multiple edges are a pair of edges such that they connect the same pair of vertices. Since the graph is undirected, the pair of edges $ (1, 2) $ and $ (2, 1) $ is considered to be multiple edges. Isolated vertex of the graph is a vertex such that there is no edge connecting this vertex to any other vertex.
Vasya wants to know the minimum and maximum possible number of isolated vertices in an undirected graph consisting of $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m~(1 \le n \le 10^5, 0 \le m \le \frac{n (n - 1)}{2}) $ .
It is guaranteed that there exists a graph without any self-loops or multiple edges with such number of vertices and edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line print two numbers $ min $ and $ max $ — the minimum and maximum number of isolated vertices, respectively.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example it is possible to construct a graph with $ 0 $ isolated vertices: for example, it should contain edges $ (1, 2) $ and $ (3, 4) $ . To get one isolated vertex, we may construct a graph with edges $ (1, 2) $ and $ (1, 3) $ .
In the second example the graph will always contain exactly one isolated vertex.</div>
