<h1>Raining season</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>By the year 3018, Summer Informatics School has greatly grown. Hotel «Berendeetronik» has been chosen as a location of the school. The camp consists of $ n $ houses with $ n-1 $ pathways between them. It is possible to reach every house from each other using the pathways.
Everything had been perfect until the rains started. The weather forecast promises that rains will continue for $ m $ days. A special squad of teachers was able to measure that the $ i $ -th pathway, connecting houses $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ , before the rain could be passed in $ b_i $ seconds. Unfortunately, the rain erodes the roads, so with every day the time to pass the road will increase by $ a_i $ seconds. In other words, on the $ t $ -th (from zero) day after the start of the rain, it will take $ a_i \cdot t + b_i $ seconds to pass through this road.
Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of teachers, even in the year 3018 not all the students are in their houses by midnight. As by midnight all students have to go to bed, it is important to find the maximal time between all the pairs of houses for each day, so every student would know the time when he has to run to his house.
Find all the maximal times of paths between every pairs of houses after $ t=0 $ , $ t=1 $ , ..., $ t=m-1 $ days.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line you are given two integers $ n $ and $ m $ — the number of houses in the camp and the number of raining days ( $ 1 \le n \le 100\,000 $ ; $ 1 \le m \le 1\,000\,000 $ ).
In the next $ n-1 $ lines you are given the integers $ u_i $ , $ v_i $ , $ a_i $ , $ b_i $ — description of pathways ( $ 1 \le u_i, v_i \le n $ ; $ 0 \le a_i \le 10^5 $ ; $ 0 \le b_i \le 10^9 $ ). $ i $ -th pathway connects houses $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ , and in day $ t $ requires $ a_i \cdot t + b_i $ seconds to pass through.
It is guaranteed that every two houses are connected by a sequence of pathways.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ integers — the lengths of the longest path in the camp after a $ t=0, t=1, \ldots, t=m-1 $ days after the start of the rain.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Let's consider the first example.
In the first three days ( $ 0 \le t \le 2 $ ) the longest path is between 2nd and 3rd houses, and its length is equal to $ 100+100=200 $ seconds.
In the third day ( $ t=2 $ ) the road between houses 1 and 4 has length $ 100 $ and keeps increasing. So, in days $ t=2, 3, 4, 5 $ the longest path is between vertices 4 and (1 or 2), and has length $ 180+10t $ . Notice, that in the day $ t=2 $ there are three pathways with length 100, so there are three maximal paths of equal length.
In the sixth day ( $ t=5 $ ) pathway between first and fifth houses get length 100. So in every day with $ t=5 $ and further the longest path is between houses 4 and 5 and has length $ 80+30t $ .</div>
