<h1>Minimum spanning tree for each edge</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
给你n个点，m条边，如果对于一个最小生成树中要求必须包括第i(1<=i<=m)条边，那么最小生成树的权值总和最小是多少。
输入格式
第一行n，m
后面m行每行u,v,w代表一条边
输出格式
m行，第i行一个整数代表包括第i条边时的最小权值和</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Connected undirected weighted graph without self-loops and multiple edges is given. Graph contains $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges.
For each edge $ (u,v) $ find the minimal possible weight of the spanning tree that contains the edge $ (u,v) $ .
The weight of the spanning tree is the sum of weights of all edges included in spanning tree.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5},n-1<=m<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices and edges in graph.
Each of the next $ m $ lines contains three integers $ u_{i},v_{i},w_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}≠v_{i},1<=w_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the endpoints of the $ i $ -th edge and its weight.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ lines. $ i $ -th line should contain the minimal possible weight of the spanning tree that contains $ i $ -th edge.
The edges are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ in order of their appearing in input.</div>
