<h1>Months and Years</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出连续的n($n \leq 24$)个月的天数，询问是否合法。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everybody in Russia uses Gregorian calendar. In this calendar there are $ 31 $ days in January, $ 28 $ or $ 29 $ days in February (depending on whether the year is leap or not), $ 31 $ days in March, $ 30 $ days in April, $ 31 $ days in May, $ 30 $ in June, $ 31 $ in July, $ 31 $ in August, $ 30 $ in September, $ 31 $ in October, $ 30 $ in November, $ 31 $ in December.
A year is leap in one of two cases: either its number is divisible by $ 4 $ , but not divisible by $ 100 $ , or is divisible by $ 400 $ . For example, the following years are leap: $ 2000 $ , $ 2004 $ , but years $ 1900 $ and $ 2018 $ are not leap.
In this problem you are given $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=24 $ ) integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , and you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of $ n $ consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is $ a_{1} $ days, duration of the next month is $ a_{2} $ days, and so on.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=24 $ ) — the number of integers.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 28<=a_{i}<=31 $ ) — the numbers you are to check.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October.
In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having $ 30 $ days.
In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June.
In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is $ 28 $ , so this is February. March follows February and has $ 31 $ days, but not $ 30 $ , so the answer is NO.
In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).</div>
