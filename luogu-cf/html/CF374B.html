<h1>Inna and Nine</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Inna loves digit $ 9 $ very much. That's why she asked Dima to write a small number consisting of nines. But Dima must have misunderstood her and he wrote a very large number $ a $ , consisting of digits from $ 1 $ to $ 9 $ .
Inna wants to slightly alter the number Dima wrote so that in the end the number contained as many digits nine as possible. In one move, Inna can choose two adjacent digits in a number which sum equals $ 9 $ and replace them by a single digit $ 9 $ .
For instance, Inna can alter number $ 14545181 $ like this: $ 14545181→1945181→194519→19919 $ . Also, she can use this method to transform number $ 14545181 $ into number $ 19991 $ . Inna will not transform it into $ 149591 $ as she can get numbers $ 19919 $ and $ 19991 $ which contain more digits nine.
Dima is a programmer so he wants to find out how many distinct numbers containing as many digits nine as possible Inna can get from the written number. Help him with this challenging task.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains integer $ a $ $ (1<=a<=10^{100000}) $ . Number $ a $ doesn't have any zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem. It is guaranteed that the answer to the problem doesn't exceed $ 2^{63}-1 $ .
Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.</div>

<div>Notes to the samples
In the first sample Inna can get the following numbers: $ 369727→99727→9997 $ , $ 369727→99727→9979 $ .
In the second sample, Inna can act like this: $ 123456789987654321→12396789987654321→1239678998769321 $ .</div>
