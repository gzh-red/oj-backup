<h1>Vika and Segments</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vika has an infinite sheet of squared paper. Initially all squares are white. She introduced a two-dimensional coordinate system on this sheet and drew $ n $ black horizontal and vertical segments parallel to the coordinate axes. All segments have width equal to $ 1 $ square, that means every segment occupy some set of neighbouring squares situated in one row or one column.
Your task is to calculate the number of painted cells. If a cell was painted more than once, it should be calculated exactly once.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of segments drawn by Vika.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains four integers $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ and $ y_{2} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the endpoints of the segments drawn by Vika. It is guaranteed that all the segments are parallel to coordinate axes. Segments may touch, overlap and even completely coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of cells painted by Vika. If a cell was painted more than once, it should be calculated exactly once in the answer.</div>
