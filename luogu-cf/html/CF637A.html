<h1>Voting for Photos</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
给定一个数组，找出出现最多的数，若有多个，输出最后一次出现时最靠前的数。
# 输入格式
两行。
第一行，一个自然数n（1<=n<=1000）
第二行，一个长度为n的数组，数组中每个数均小于1000000。
# 输出格式
一行，出现最多的数中，最后一次出现时最靠前的数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After celebrating the midcourse the students of one of the faculties of the Berland State University decided to conduct a vote for the best photo. They published the photos in the social network and agreed on the rules to choose a winner: the photo which gets most likes wins. If multiple photoes get most likes, the winner is the photo that gets this number first.
Help guys determine the winner photo by the records of likes.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — the total likes to the published photoes.
The second line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=1000000 $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the identifier of the photo which got the $ i $ -th like.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the identifier of the photo which won the elections.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
1 3 2 2 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9
100 200 300 200 100 300 300 100 200
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>300
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test sample the photo with id 1 got two likes (first and fifth), photo with id 2 got two likes (third and fourth), and photo with id 3 got one like (second).
Thus, the winner is the photo with identifier 2, as it got:
- more likes than the photo with id 3;
- as many likes as the photo with id 1, but the photo with the identifier 2 got its second like earlier.</div>
