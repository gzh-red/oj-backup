<div>## 题目描述
Petya在一所学校里学习数学。他们班最近在学算数表达式。最后一节课，老师在黑板上写了三个正整数a，b，c。他们的任务是在他们之间插入运算符号"+"和"* "来使得运算结果最大（可能会添加括号）。但是不能改变数字的顺序。
现在给你三个数，你要输出最大的可能。
## 输入输出格式
##### 输入格式
三个正整数a，b，c，一个一行。（1<=a,b,c<=10）
##### 输出格式
输出能得到的最大的数。
## 说明
从给的四个式子来看最大的可能是9。
不可以写成（1+3）* 2。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '\*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:
- 1+2\*3=7
- 1\*(2+3)=5
- 1\*2\*3=6
- (1+2)\*3=9
Note that you can insert operation signs only between $ a $ and $ b $ , and between $ b $ and $ c $ , that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)\*2.
It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
Your task is: given $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ print the maximum value that you can get.</div>
