<h1>Three-level Laser</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个长度为$n(n\le 10^5)$的严格单调递增整数序列$\{E\}(E_i\le 10^9)$，求$i,j,k(i<j<k)$使得$\eta=\frac{E_k-E_j}{E_k-E_i}$最大且$E_k-E_i\le U(U\le 10^9)$，输出这个$\eta$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>An atom of element X can exist in $ n $ distinct states with energies $ E_{1}<E_{2}<...<E_{n} $ . Arkady wants to build a laser on this element, using a three-level scheme. Here is a simplified description of the scheme. Three distinct states $ i $ , $ j $ and $ k $ are selected, where $ i<j<k $ . After that the following process happens: 1. initially the atom is in the state $ i $ , 2. we spend $ E_{k}-E_{i} $ energy to put the atom in the state $ k $ , 3. the atom emits a photon with useful energy $ E_{k}-E_{j} $ and changes its state to the state $ j $ , 4. the atom spontaneously changes its state to the state $ i $ , losing energy $ E_{j}-E_{i} $ , 5. the process repeats from step 1. Let's define the energy conversion efficiency as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF924B/dd021747dbc78de91e905a31390ad0cfead20383.png), i. e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.

Due to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states that $ E_{k}-E_{i}<=U $ .

Help Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ U $ ( $ 3<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 1<=U<=10^{9} $ ) — the number of states and the maximum possible difference between $ E_{k} $ and $ E_{i} $ .

The second line contains a sequence of integers $ E_{1},E_{2},...,E_{n} $ ( $ 1<=E_{1}<E_{2}...<E_{n}<=10^{9} $ ). It is guaranteed that all $ E_{i} $ are given in increasing order.</div>
    <h3>输出格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>If it is not possible to choose three states that satisfy all constraints, print -1.

Otherwise, print one real number $ η $ — the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency. Your answer is considered correct its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-9} $ .

Formally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ . Your answer is considered correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF924B/b096933069cd16441a106d6e431b8a276a9bc4f3.png).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example choose states $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ , so that the energy conversion efficiency becomes equal to ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF924B/dce12a2cd3991eb50251b026c5d21e8a7972a1a8.png).
In the second example choose states $ 4 $ , $ 5 $ and $ 9 $ , so that the energy conversion efficiency becomes equal to ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF924B/92eb31d78d8cae5d41f0d6508215bf8fc27fa5c7.png).</div>
