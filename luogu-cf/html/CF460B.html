<h1>Little Dima and Equation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Dima misbehaved during a math lesson a lot and the nasty teacher Mr. Pickles gave him the following problem as a punishment.
Find all integer solutions $ x $ $ (0&lt;x&lt;10^{9}) $ of the equation:
$ x=b·s(x)^{a}+c, $ where $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ are some predetermined constant values and function $ s(x) $ determines the sum of all digits in the decimal representation of number $ x $ .
The teacher gives this problem to Dima for each lesson. He changes only the parameters of the equation: $ a $ , $ b $ , $ c $ . Dima got sick of getting bad marks and he asks you to help him solve this challenging problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three space-separated integers: $ a,b,c $ $ (1<=a<=5; 1<=b<=10000; -10000<=c<=10000) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print integer $ n $ — the number of the solutions that you've found. Next print $ n $ integers in the increasing order — the solutions of the given equation. Print only integer solutions that are larger than zero and strictly less than $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
