<h1>Hexadecimal&#039;s Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入n，输出1-n的自然数中各数位只包含0和1的数的个数。
Translated by @Lolierl </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One beautiful July morning a terrible thing happened in Mainframe: a mean virus Megabyte somehow got access to the memory of his not less mean sister Hexadecimal. He loaded there a huge amount of $ n $ different natural numbers from 1 to $ n $ to obtain total control over her energy.
But his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn't perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input data contains the only number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the only number — answer to the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>10
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For $ n $ = 10 the answer includes numbers 1 and 10.</div>
