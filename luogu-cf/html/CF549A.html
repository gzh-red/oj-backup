<h1>Face Detection</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The developers of Looksery have to write an efficient algorithm that detects faces on a picture. Unfortunately, they are currently busy preparing a contest for you, so you will have to do it for them.
In this problem an image is a rectangular table that consists of lowercase Latin letters. A face on the image is a $ 2×2 $ square, such that from the four letters of this square you can make word "face".
You need to write a program that determines the number of faces on the image. The squares that correspond to the faces can overlap.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers, $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=50 $ ) — the height and the width of the image, respectively.
Next $ n $ lines define the image. Each line contains $ m $ lowercase Latin letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the single line print the number of faces on the image.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample the image contains a single face, located in a square with the upper left corner at the second line and the second column:

In the third sample two faces are shown:
