<h1>Vasya and Cornfield</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n$、$d$，构造四个顶点为 $(0, d), (d, 0), (n, n - d)$ 和$ (n - d, n)$ 的矩形，有$k$次询问，每次询问坐标为$(x_i,y_i)$的点是否在正方形内（包括边界）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya owns a cornfield which can be defined with two integers $ n $ and $ d $ . The cornfield can be represented as rectangle with vertices having Cartesian coordinates $ (0, d), (d, 0), (n, n - d) $ and $ (n - d, n) $ .
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1030B/104e0bfeaf07ab93dff4c549bd13618b0eb766eb.png)An example of a cornfield with $ n = 7 $ and $ d = 2 $ .Vasya also knows that there are $ m $ grasshoppers near the field (maybe even inside it). The $ i $ -th grasshopper is at the point $ (x_i, y_i) $ . Vasya does not like when grasshoppers eat his corn, so for each grasshopper he wants to know whether its position is inside the cornfield (including the border) or outside.
Help Vasya! For each grasshopper determine if it is inside the field (including the border).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ d $ ( $ 1 \le d < n \le 100 $ ).
The second line contains a single integer $ m $ ( $ 1 \le m \le 100 $ ) — the number of grasshoppers.
The $ i $ -th of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ ( $ 0 \le x_i, y_i \le n $ ) — position of the $ i $ -th grasshopper.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ m $ lines. The $ i $ -th line should contain "YES" if the position of the $ i $ -th grasshopper lies inside or on the border of the cornfield. Otherwise the $ i $ -th line should contain "NO".
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>The cornfield from the first example is pictured above. Grasshoppers with indices $ 1 $ (coordinates $ (2, 4) $ ) and $ 4 $ (coordinates $ (4, 5) $ ) are inside the cornfield.
The cornfield from the second example is pictured below. Grasshoppers with indices $ 1 $ (coordinates $ (4, 4) $ ), $ 3 $ (coordinates $ (8, 1) $ ) and $ 4 $ (coordinates $ (6, 1) $ ) are inside the cornfield.
