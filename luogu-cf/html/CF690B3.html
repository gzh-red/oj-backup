<h1>Recover Polygon (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Zombies have found out about the Zombie Contamination level checker and managed to damage it! Now detecting the shape of their main compound will be a real challenge for Heidi. As before, a lair can be represented as a strictly convex polygon on a lattice. Each vertex of the polygon occupies a point on the lattice. However, the damaged Zombie Contamination level checker can only tell, for each cell, whether the level of Zombie Contamination for that cell is in the set $ {1,2,3} $ . In other words, Heidi knows all the cells of the lattice for which the Contamination level is not $ 0 $ and not $ 4 $ .
Given this information, Heidi still wants to know the exact shape of the lair to rain destruction on the zombies. Help her!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains multiple test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $ N $ and $ M $ , where $ N $ is the size of the lattice grid ( $ 5<=N<=100000 $ ) and $ M $ is the number of lattice points for which the Zombie Contamination level is 1, 2, or 3 ( $ 8<=M<=200000 $ ).
The second line of each test case contains $ M $ pairs of integers $ x_{1},y_{1},...,x_{M},y_{M} $ – coordinates of the cells with Zombie Contamination level not equal to 0 nor 4. It is guaranteed that $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=N $ . All pairs $ x_{i},y_{i} $ are different.
Cells are enumerated based on the coordinates of their upper right corner. This means that the bottommost leftmost cell that touches the origin has coordinates $ (1,1) $ , and the uppermost leftmost cell is identified as $ (1,N) $ .
The last line of the file contains two zeroes. This line should not be treated as a test case. The sum of the $ M $ values for all tests in one file will not exceed $ 200000 $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, the following output is expected:
The first line of the output should contain one integer $ V $ , the number of vertices of the polygon that is the secret lair. The next $ V $ lines each should contain two integers, denoting the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise order, starting from the lexicographically smallest vertex.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>It is guaranteed that the solution always exists and is unique. It is guaranteed that in the correct solution the coordinates of the polygon vertices are between $ 1 $ and $ N-1 $ . A vertex $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ is lexicographically smaller than vertex $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ if $ x_{1}<x_{2} $ or ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF690B3/d2bfbe49d551bf0cc9cbeba8f0c1469bad61d202.png).</div>
