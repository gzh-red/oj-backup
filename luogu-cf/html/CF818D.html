<h1>Multicolored Cars</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题目描述】
定义$cnt_{x}(i)$表示到$i$时刻$x$出现过的个数。
现在给出$n$个数$a_{1},a_{2}……a_{n}$,$a_{i}$表示时刻$i$出现的数。$Alice$选择了一个数$m$，请帮助$Bob$选择一个数$k$，使得对任意时刻$i$，都有$cnt_{k}(i)>=cnt_{m}(i)$。若不存在这样的$k$请输出$-1$。
【输入格式】
第一行两个整数$n$,$m$,表示有$n$个数，$Alice$选择了的数$m$。
第二行$n$个整数$a_{1},a_{2}……a_{n}$，$a_{i}$表示时刻$i$出现的数。
【输出格式】
存在这样的$k$请输出任意一个可行解，若不存在这样的$k$请输出$-1$。
【数据范围】
所有数不超过$10^6$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice and Bob got very bored during a long car trip so they decided to play a game. From the window they can see cars of different colors running past them. Cars are going one after another.
The game rules are like this. Firstly Alice chooses some color $ A $ , then Bob chooses some color $ B $ ( $ A≠B $ ). After each car they update the number of cars of their chosen color that have run past them. Let's define this numbers after $ i $ -th car $ cnt_{A}(i) $ and $ cnt_{B}(i) $ .
- If $ cnt_{A}(i)&gt;cnt_{B}(i) $ for every $ i $ then the winner is Alice.
- If $ cnt_{B}(i)>=cnt_{A}(i) $ for every $ i $ then the winner is Bob.
- Otherwise it's a draw.
Bob knows all the colors of cars that they will encounter and order of their appearance. Alice have already chosen her color $ A $ and Bob now wants to choose such color $ B $ that he will win the game (draw is not a win). Help him find this color.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no such color then print -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integer numbers $ n $ and $ A $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5},1<=A<=10^{6} $ ) – number of cars and the color chosen by Alice.
The second line contains $ n $ integer numbers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=10^{6} $ ) — colors of the cars that Alice and Bob will encounter in the order of their appearance.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output such color $ B $ ( $ 1<=B<=10^{6} $ ) that if Bob chooses it then he will win the game. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no such color then print -1.
It is guaranteed that if there exists any solution then there exists solution with ( $ 1<=B<=10^{6} $ ).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Let's consider availability of colors in the first example:
- $ cnt_{2}(i)>=cnt_{1}(i) $ for every $ i $ , and color $ 2 $ can be the answer.
- $ cnt_{4}(2)&lt;cnt_{1}(2) $ , so color $ 4 $ isn't the winning one for Bob.
- All the other colors also have $ cnt_{j}(2)&lt;cnt_{1}(2) $ , thus they are not available.
In the third example every color is acceptable except for $ 10 $ .</div>
