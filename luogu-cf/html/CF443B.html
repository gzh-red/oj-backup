<h1>Kolya and Tandem Repeat</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kolya got string $ s $ for his birthday, the string consists of small English letters. He immediately added $ k $ more characters to the right of the string.
Then Borya came and said that the new string contained a tandem repeat of length $ l $ as a substring. How large could $ l $ be?
See notes for definition of a tandem repeat.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=200 $ ). This string contains only small English letters. The second line contains number $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=200 $ ) — the number of the added characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single number — the maximum length of the tandem repeat that could have occurred in the new string.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>A tandem repeat of length $ 2n $ is string $ s $ , where for any position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) the following condition fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{i+n} $ .
In the first sample Kolya could obtain a string aabaab, in the second — aaabbbbbb, in the third — abracadabrabracadabra.</div>
