<h1>Dense Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string $ s $ , consisting of lowercase English letters, and the integer $ m $ .
One should choose some symbols from the given string so that any contiguous subsegment of length $ m $ has at least one selected symbol. Note that here we choose positions of symbols, not the symbols themselves.
Then one uses the chosen symbols to form a new string. All symbols from the chosen position should be used, but we are allowed to rearrange them in any order.
Formally, we choose a subsequence of indices $ 1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{t}<=|s| $ . The selected sequence must meet the following condition: for every $ j $ such that $ 1<=j<=|s|-m+1 $ , there must be at least one selected index that belongs to the segment $ [j, j+m-1] $ , i.e. there should exist a $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ t $ , such that $ j<=i_{k}<=j+m-1 $ .
Then we take any permutation $ p $ of the selected indices and form a new string $ s_{ip1}s_{ip2}...\ s_{ipt} $ .
Find the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using this procedure.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=100000 $ ).
The second line contains the string $ s $ consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that this string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed $ 100000 $ . It is also guaranteed that the number $ m $ doesn't exceed the length of the string $ s $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the single line containing the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using the procedure described above.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, one can choose the subsequence $ {3} $ and form a string "a".
In the second sample, one can choose the subsequence $ {1,2,4} $ (symbols on this positions are 'a', 'b' and 'a') and rearrange the chosen symbols to form a string "aab".</div>
