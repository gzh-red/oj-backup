<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's denote as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF484A/b30c9ebcde0f9929e0344fbd7e7dae947e957ee2.png) the number of bits set ('1' bits) in the binary representation of the non-negative integer $ x $ .
You are given multiple queries consisting of pairs of integers $ l $ and $ r $ . For each query, find the $ x $ , such that $ l<=x<=r $ , and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF484A/b30c9ebcde0f9929e0344fbd7e7dae947e957ee2.png) is maximum possible. If there are multiple such numbers find the smallest of them.</div>
