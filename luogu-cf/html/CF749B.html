<h1>Parallelogram is Back</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一个平行四边形的三个顶点，输出第四个点的可能位置数量和这些位置
感谢@Fheiwn 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Long time ago Alex created an interesting problem about parallelogram. The input data for this problem contained four integer points on the Cartesian plane, that defined the set of vertices of some non-degenerate (positive area) parallelogram. Points not necessary were given in the order of clockwise or counterclockwise traversal.
Alex had very nice test for this problem, but is somehow happened that the last line of the input was lost and now he has only three out of four points of the original parallelogram. He remembers that test was so good that he asks you to restore it given only these three points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of three lines, each containing a pair of integer coordinates $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ -1000<=x_{i},y_{i}<=1000 $ ). It's guaranteed that these three points do not lie on the same line and no two of them coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First print integer $ k $ — the number of ways to add one new integer point such that the obtained set defines some parallelogram of positive area. There is no requirement for the points to be arranged in any special order (like traversal), they just define the set of vertices.
Then print $ k $ lines, each containing a pair of integer — possible coordinates of the fourth point.</div>
