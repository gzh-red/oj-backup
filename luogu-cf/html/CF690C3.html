<h1>Brain Network (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Breaking news from zombie neurology! It turns out that – contrary to previous beliefs – every zombie is born with a single brain, and only later it evolves into a complicated brain structure. In fact, whenever a zombie consumes a brain, a new brain appears in its nervous system and gets immediately connected to one of the already existing brains using a single brain connector. Researchers are now interested in monitoring the brain latency of a zombie. Your task is to write a program which, given a history of evolution of a zombie's nervous system, computes its brain latency at every stage.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one number $ n $ – the number of brains in the final nervous system ( $ 2<=n<=200000 $ ). In the second line a history of zombie's nervous system evolution is given. For convenience, we number all the brains by $ 1,2,...,n $ in the same order as they appear in the nervous system (the zombie is born with a single brain, number $ 1 $ , and subsequently brains $ 2,3,...,n $ are added). The second line contains $ n-1 $ space-separated numbers $ p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{n} $ , meaning that after a new brain $ k $ is added to the system, it gets connected to a parent-brain ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF690C3/b7b76d65e68a74cf783f112f6bfb091b261aef80.png).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n-1 $ space-separated numbers – the brain latencies after the brain number $ k $ is added, for $ k=2,3,...,n $ .</div>
