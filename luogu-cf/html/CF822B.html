<h1>Crossword solving</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出两个字符串s,t和它们的长度,你可以将s中一些字符改成'?','?'可以代替任何的字符.要让s是t的子串,输出至少要改变s中的多少个字符,并且按任意顺序输出从1开始改变的字符的位置.
感谢@Fuko_Ibuki 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Erelong Leha was bored by calculating of the greatest common divisor of two factorials. Therefore he decided to solve some crosswords. It's well known that it is a very interesting occupation though it can be very difficult from time to time. In the course of solving one of the crosswords, Leha had to solve a simple task. You are able to do it too, aren't you?
Leha has two strings $ s $ and $ t $ . The hacker wants to change the string $ s $ at such way, that it can be found in $ t $ as a substring. All the changes should be the following: Leha chooses one position in the string $ s $ and replaces the symbol in this position with the question mark "?". The hacker is sure that the question mark in comparison can play the role of an arbitrary symbol. For example, if he gets string $ s $ ="ab?b" as a result, it will appear in $ t $ ="aabrbb" as a substring.
Guaranteed that the length of the string $ s $ doesn't exceed the length of the string $ t $ . Help the hacker to replace in $ s $ as few symbols as possible so that the result of the replacements can be found in $ t $ as a substring. The symbol "?" should be considered equal to any other symbol.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=m<=1000 $ ) — the length of the string $ s $ and the length of the string $ t $ correspondingly.
The second line contains $ n $ lowercase English letters — string $ s $ .
The third line contains $ m $ lowercase English letters — string $ t $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print single integer $ k $ — the minimal number of symbols that need to be replaced.
In the second line print $ k $ distinct integers denoting the positions of symbols in the string $ s $ which need to be replaced. Print the positions in any order. If there are several solutions print any of them. The numbering of the positions begins from one.</div>
