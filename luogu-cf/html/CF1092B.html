<h1>Teams Forming</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在有n个学生（n保证为偶数），每个学生有一个能力值a。
教练想将学生分成两两一组，但前提条件是学生的能力值相同，而学生的能力值可以通过解题来提升，每解1道题，能力值提升1。现在要求所有学生解题数最少，并达到分成两两一组的条件，请问最少需要解多少道题？
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= a <= 100
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ students in a university. The number of students is even. The $ i $ -th student has programming skill equal to $ a_i $ .
The coach wants to form $ \frac{n}{2} $ teams. Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal (otherwise they cannot understand each other and cannot form a team).
Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.
The coach wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly $ \frac{n}{2} $ teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to find this number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of students. It is guaranteed that $ n $ is even.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 100 $ ), where $ a_i $ is the skill of the $ i $ -th student.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one number — the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly $ \frac{n}{2} $ teams.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>

<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>

</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the optimal teams will be: $ (3, 4) $ , $ (1, 6) $ and $ (2, 5) $ , where numbers in brackets are indices of students. Then, to form the first team the third student should solve $ 1 $ problem, to form the second team nobody needs to solve problems and to form the third team the second student should solve $ 4 $ problems so the answer is $ 1 + 4 = 5 $ .
In the second example the first student should solve $ 99 $ problems to form a team with the second one.</div>
