<h1>Coins</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出 $n$ 和 $S$，求最小的 $m$，使存在 $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}a_i = S$，其中 $a_i$ 为 $[1,\ n]$ 中的整数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have unlimited number of coins with values $ 1, 2, \ldots, n $ . You want to select some set of coins having the total value of $ S $ .
It is allowed to have multiple coins with the same value in the set. What is the minimum number of coins required to get sum $ S $ ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ S $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100\,000 $ , $ 1 \le S \le 10^9 $ )</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print exactly one integer — the minimum number of coins required to obtain sum $ S $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 11
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>6 16
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>3</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, some of the possible ways to get sum $ 11 $ with $ 3 $ coins are:
- $ (3, 4, 4) $
- $ (2, 4, 5) $
- $ (1, 5, 5) $
- $ (3, 3, 5) $
It is impossible to get sum $ 11 $ with less than $ 3 $ coins.
In the second example, some of the possible ways to get sum $ 16 $ with $ 3 $ coins are:
- $ (5, 5, 6) $
- $ (4, 6, 6) $
It is impossible to get sum $ 16 $ with less than $ 3 $ coins.</div>
