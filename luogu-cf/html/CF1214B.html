Vasya prepared $ n+1 $ decks of badges. The $ i $ -th (where $ i $ is from $ 0 $ to $ n $ , inclusive) deck contains $ i $ blue badges and $ n-i $ red ones. The total number of badges in any deck is exactly $ n $ .
Determine the minimum number of decks among these $ n+1 $ that Vasya should take, so that there will be a suitable deck no matter how many girls and boys there will be among the participants of the tournament.</div>
