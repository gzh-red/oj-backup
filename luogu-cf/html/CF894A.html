<h1>QAQ</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意： 给定一个字符串，字符串长度<=100，现在要求出字符串中'QAQ'的个数，注意，'QAQ'可以不连续，只要有顺序就可以了，例如QABQ也有一个QAQ
Translated by @Hjl1777 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>"QAQ" is a word to denote an expression of crying. Imagine "Q" as eyes with tears and "A" as a mouth.
Now Diamond has given Bort a string consisting of only uppercase English letters of length $ n $ . There is a great number of "QAQ" in the string (Diamond is so cute!).
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF894A/333c4dadce3b03c143ff500b3cc7457c4f2b76a3.png)illustration by 猫屋 https://twitter.com/nekoyaliuBort wants to know how many subsequences "QAQ" are in the string Diamond has given. Note that the letters "QAQ" don't have to be consecutive, but the order of letters should be exact.</div>
