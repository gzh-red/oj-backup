<h1>Prime Swaps</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have an array $ a[1],a[2],...,a[n] $ , containing distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Your task is to sort this array in increasing order with the following operation (you may need to apply it multiple times):
- choose two indexes, $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ ; $ (j-i+1) $ is a prime number);
- swap the elements on positions $ i $ and $ j $ ; in other words, you are allowed to apply the following sequence of assignments: $ tmp=a[i],a[i]=a[j],a[j]=tmp $ ( $ tmp $ is a temporary variable).
You do not need to minimize the number of used operations. However, you need to make sure that there are at most $ 5n $ operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ . The next line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a[1],a[2],...,a[n] $ $ (1<=a[i]<=n) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, print integer $ k $ $ (0<=k<=5n) $ — the number of used operations. Next, print the operations. Each operation must be printed as " $ i $ $ j $ " ( $ 1<=i&lt;j<=n $ ; $ (j-i+1) $ is a prime).
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.</div>
