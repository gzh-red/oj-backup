<h1>Lucky Division</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题目描述】Petya喜欢数字，他将4和7视为幸运数字。如果一个数能由4与7组成，他就是幸运数字，只要能被幸运数字整除的也算幸运数字！现给定一个数字，判断它是否是幸运数。
【输入格式】一个整数n(1<=n<=1000)
【输出格式】若n是幸运数或接近幸运数，输出“YES”；否则输出“NO”。（“”不用输出）
感谢@隐鬼在侧 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number $ n $ is almost lucky.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=1000) $ — the number that needs to be checked.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number $ n $ is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>47
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>16
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>78
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #3</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.
In the first sample $ 47 $ is a lucky number. In the second sample $ 16 $ is divisible by $ 4 $ .</div>
