<h1>Matrix Walk</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a matrix $ A $ of size $ x×y $ filled with integers. For every ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF954C/4052ad629d73d292f3d91ab28d288872054d305e.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF954C/4f9a677c517f4ca1a07ede7e6a04818468f95dc9.png) $ A_{i,j}=y(i-1)+j $ . Obviously, every integer from $ [1..xy] $ occurs exactly once in this matrix.
You have traversed some path in this matrix. Your path can be described as a sequence of visited cells $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ denoting that you started in the cell containing the number $ a_{1} $ , then moved to the cell with the number $ a_{2} $ , and so on.
From the cell located in $ i $ -th line and $ j $ -th column (we denote this cell as $ (i,j) $ ) you can move into one of the following cells:
1. $ (i+1,j) $ — only if $ i&lt;x $ ;
2. $ (i,j+1) $ — only if $ j&lt;y $ ;
3. $ (i-1,j) $ — only if $ i&gt;1 $ ;
4. $ (i,j-1) $ — only if $ j&gt;1 $ .
Notice that making a move requires you to go to an adjacent cell. It is not allowed to stay in the same cell. You don't know $ x $ and $ y $ exactly, but you have to find any possible values for these numbers such that you could start in the cell containing the integer $ a_{1} $ , then move to the cell containing $ a_{2} $ (in one step), then move to the cell containing $ a_{3} $ (also in one step) and so on. Can you choose $ x $ and $ y $ so that they don't contradict with your sequence of moves?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of cells you visited on your path (if some cell is visited twice, then it's listed twice).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ , ..., $ a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the integers in the cells on your path.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If all possible values of $ x $ and $ y $ such that $ 1<=x,y<=10^{9} $ contradict with the information about your path, print NO.
Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and in the second line print the values $ x $ and $ y $ such that your path was possible with such number of lines and columns in the matrix. Remember that they must be positive integers not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ .</div>
