<h1>Intersection</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一组满足函数$A_1x+B_1y+C_1=0$ 的点和另一组满足函数$A_2x+B_2y+C_2=0$ 的点中，在两组中都包含的点有几个？
输入输出格式：
输入格式：
第一行包含3个整数$A_1,B_1,C_1$ 。
第二行包含3个整数$A_2,B_2,C_2$ 。
（$-100<=A_1,B_1,C_1,A_2,B_2,C_2<=100$ )
输出格式：
输出直线交点个数，如果有无数个，请输出$-1$ 。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two set of points. The first set is determined by the equation $ A_{1}x+B_{1}y+C_{1}=0 $ , and the second one is determined by the equation $ A_{2}x+B_{2}y+C_{2}=0 $ .
Write the program which finds the number of points in the intersection of two given sets.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integer numbers $ A_{1},B_{1},C_{1} $ separated by space. The second line contains three integer numbers $ A_{2},B_{2},C_{2} $ separated by space. All the numbers are between -100 and 100, inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of points in the intersection or -1 if there are infinite number of points.</div>
