<div>Little Petya wanted to give an April Fools Day present to some scientists. After some hesitation he decided to give them the array that he got as a present in Codeforces Round #153 (Div.2). The scientists rejoiced at the gift and decided to put some important facts to this array. Here are the first few of the facts:
- The highest mountain above sea level in the world is Mount Everest. Its peak rises to 8848 m.
- The largest board game tournament consisted of 958 participants playing chapaev.
