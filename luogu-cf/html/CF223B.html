<h1>Two Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A subsequence of length $ |x| $ of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ (where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ ) is a string $ x=s_{k1}s_{k2}...\ s_{k|x|} $ $ (1<=k_{1}&lt;k_{2}&lt;...&lt;k_{|x|}<=|s|) $ .
You've got two strings — $ s $ and $ t $ . Let's consider all subsequences of string $ s $ , coinciding with string $ t $ . Is it true that each character of string $ s $ occurs in at least one of these subsequences? In other words, is it true that for all $ i $ $ (1<=i<=|s|) $ , there is such subsequence $ x=s_{k1}s_{k2}...\ s_{k|x|} $ of string $ s $ , that $ x=t $ and for some $ j $ $ (1<=j<=|x|) $ $ k_{j}=i $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains string $ s $ , the second line contains string $ t $ . Each line consists only of lowercase English letters. The given strings are non-empty, the length of each string does not exceed $ 2·10^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "Yes" (without the quotes), if each character of the string $ s $ occurs in at least one of the described subsequences, or "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample string $ t $ can occur in the string $ s $ as a subsequence in three ways: abab, abab and abab. In these occurrences each character of string $ s $ occurs at least once.
In the second sample the 4-th character of the string $ s $ doesn't occur in any occurrence of string $ t $ .
In the third sample there is no occurrence of string $ t $ in string $ s $ .</div>
