<h1>Bear and Colors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bear Limak has $ n $ colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ , from left to right. There are $ n $ possible colors, also numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ . The $ i $ -th ball has color $ t_{i} $ .
For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.
There are ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF643A/e72cbeaa17cceea137ec85134680a8c41a08d995.png) non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=5000 $ ) — the number of balls.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=n $ ) where $ t_{i} $ is the color of the $ i $ -th ball.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ n $ integers. The $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where $ i $ is a dominant color.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, color $ 2 $ is dominant in three intervals:
- An interval $ [2,2] $ contains one ball. This ball's color is $ 2 $ so it's clearly a dominant color.
- An interval $ [4,4] $ contains one ball, with color $ 2 $ again.
- An interval $ [2,4] $ contains two balls of color $ 2 $ and one ball of color $ 1 $ .
There are $ 7 $ more intervals and color $ 1 $ is dominant in all of them.</div>
