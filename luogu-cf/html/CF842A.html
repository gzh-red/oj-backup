<h1>Kirill And The Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kirill plays a new computer game. He came to the potion store where he can buy any potion. Each potion is characterized by two integers — amount of experience and cost. The efficiency of a potion is the ratio of the amount of experience to the cost. Efficiency may be a non-integer number.
For each two integer numbers $ a $ and $ b $ such that $ l<=a<=r $ and $ x<=b<=y $ there is a potion with experience $ a $ and cost $ b $ in the store (that is, there are $ (r-l+1)·(y-x+1) $ potions).
Kirill wants to buy a potion which has efficiency $ k $ . Will he be able to do this?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First string contains five integer numbers $ l $ , $ r $ , $ x $ , $ y $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=10^{7} $ , $ 1<=x<=y<=10^{7} $ , $ 1<=k<=10^{7} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" without quotes if a potion with efficiency exactly $ k $ can be bought in the store and "NO" without quotes otherwise.
You can output each of the letters in any register.</div>
