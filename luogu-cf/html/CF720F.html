<h1>Array Covering</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Misha has an array of integers of length $ n $ . He wants to choose $ k $ different continuous subarrays, so that each element of the array belongs to at least one of the chosen subarrays.
Misha wants to choose the subarrays in such a way that if he calculated the sum of elements for each subarray, and then add up all these sums, the resulting value was maximum possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers: $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=k<=n·(n+1)/2 $ ) — the number of elements in the array and the number of different subarrays that must be chosen.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ -50000<=a_{i}<=50000 $ ) — the elements of the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer — the maximum possible value Misha can get by choosing $ k $ different subarrays.</div>
