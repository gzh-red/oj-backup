<h1>Balanced Removals (Easier)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is an easier version of the problem. In this version, $ n \le 2000 $ .
There are $ n $ distinct points in three-dimensional space numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The $ i $ -th point has coordinates $ (x_i, y_i, z_i) $ . The number of points $ n $ is even.
You'd like to remove all $ n $ points using a sequence of $ \frac{n}{2} $ snaps. In one snap, you can remove any two points $ a $ and $ b $ that have not been removed yet and form a perfectly balanced pair. A pair of points $ a $ and $ b $ is perfectly balanced if no other point $ c $ (that has not been removed yet) lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $ a $ and $ b $ .
Formally, point $ c $ lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points $ a $ and $ b $ if and only if $ \min(x_a, x_b) \le x_c \le \max(x_a, x_b) $ , $ \min(y_a, y_b) \le y_c \le \max(y_a, y_b) $ , and $ \min(z_a, z_b) \le z_c \le \max(z_a, z_b) $ . Note that the bounding box might be degenerate.
Find a way to remove all points in $ \frac{n}{2} $ snaps.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 2000 $ ; $ n $ is even), denoting the number of points.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains three integers $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ , $ z_i $ ( $ -10^8 \le x_i, y_i, z_i \le 10^8 $ ), denoting the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point.
No two points coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ \frac{n}{2} $ pairs of integers $ a_i, b_i $ ( $ 1 \le a_i, b_i \le n $ ), denoting the indices of points removed on snap $ i $ . Every integer between $ 1 $ and $ n $ , inclusive, must appear in your output exactly once.
We can show that it is always possible to remove all points. If there are many solutions, output any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, here is what points and their corresponding bounding boxes look like (drawn in two dimensions for simplicity, as all points lie on $ z = 0 $ plane). Note that order of removing matters: for example, points $ 5 $ and $ 1 $ don't form a perfectly balanced pair initially, but they do after point $ 3 $ is removed.
