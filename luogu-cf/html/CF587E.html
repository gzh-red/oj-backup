<h1>Duff as a Queen</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个序列，请支持以下下两种操作。
1.将一个区间内的元素全部异或同一个数。
2.询问一个区间内有多少种任意子集的异或值。即对于这个区间内的元素，任取一个子集，将子集内的元素异或起来，问有多少种异或值。(空集合法，异或值为0)</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Duff is the queen of her country, Andarz Gu. She's a competitive programming fan. That's why, when he saw her minister, Malek, free, she gave her a sequence consisting of $ n $ non-negative integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ and asked him to perform $ q $ queries for her on this sequence.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587E/13c69dfd57d48044360a9b122095311a6f41fd5f.png)There are two types of queries:
1. given numbers $ l,r $ and $ k $ , Malek should perform ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587E/8a1be9e3c00e9730bbb643a5d7ee378a339f739b.png) for each $ l<=i<=r $ (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587E/5b5823515617df7c58796c723b273483849bc16e.png), bitwise exclusive OR of numbers $ a $ and $ b $ ).
2. given numbers $ l $ and $ r $ Malek should tell her the score of sequence $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...\ ,a_{r} $ .
Score of a sequence $ b_{1},...,b_{k} $ is the number of its different Kheshtaks. A non-negative integer $ w $ is a Kheshtak of this sequence if and only if there exists a subsequence of $ b $ , let's denote it as $ b_{i1},b_{i2},...\ ,b_{ix} $ (possibly empty) such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587E/1e3a601936704cd1f565653c79e75d2cbcc0e258.png) ( $ 1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{x}<=k $ ). If this subsequence is empty, then $ w=0 $ .
Unlike Duff, Malek is not a programmer. That's why he asked for your help. Please help him perform these queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers, $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=2×10^{5} $ and $ 1<=q<=4×10^{4} $ ).
The second line of input contains $ n $ integers, $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ separated by spaces ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ for each $ 1<=i<=n $ ).
The next $ q $ lines contain the queries. Each line starts with an integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=2 $ ), type of the corresponding query. If $ t=1 $ , then there are three more integers in that line, $ l,r $ and $ k $ . Otherwise there are two more integers, $ l $ and $ r $ . ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ and $ 0<=k<=10^{9} $ )</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<div>Print the answer of each query of the second type in one line.</div>

<div>In the first query, we want all Kheshtaks of sequence $ 1,2,3,4,2 $ which are: $ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 $ .
In the third query, we want all Khestaks of sequence $ 1,10,3,4,2 $ which are: $ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 $ .
In the fifth query, we want all Kheshtaks of sequence $ 0 $ which is $ 0 $ .</div>
