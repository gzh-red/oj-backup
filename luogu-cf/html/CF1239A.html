<h1>Ivan the Fool and the Probability Theory</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个 $n \times m$ 的方格图，每个格子可以被染成黑色或白色，且与其相邻的格子（上，下，左，右）中至多只有一个与其颜色相同。求方案数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently Ivan the Fool decided to become smarter and study the probability theory. He thinks that he understands the subject fairly well, and so he began to behave like he already got PhD in that area.
To prove his skills, Ivan decided to demonstrate his friends a concept of random picture. A picture is a field of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns, where each cell is either black or white. Ivan calls the picture random if for every cell it has at most one adjacent cell of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.
Ivan's brothers spent some time trying to explain that it's not how the randomness usually works. Trying to convince Ivan, they want to count the number of different random (according to Ivan) pictures. Two pictures are considered different if at least one cell on those two picture is colored differently. Since the number of such pictures may be quite large, print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .</div>
