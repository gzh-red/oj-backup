<h1>Very Beautiful Number</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题意简述
给你两个数p,x，求很漂亮的数字。
很漂亮数字的要求：这个数有p位，将最后一位数字移到开头组成一个新数，这个新数是原数的x倍，求最小的很漂亮的数。如果没有找到这个数，输出“Impossible”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Teacher thinks that we make a lot of progress. Now we are even allowed to use decimal notation instead of counting sticks. After the test the teacher promised to show us a "very beautiful number". But the problem is, he's left his paper with the number in the teachers' office.
The teacher remembers that the "very beautiful number" was strictly positive, didn't contain any leading zeroes, had the length of exactly $ p $ decimal digits, and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly $ x $ times. Besides, the teacher is sure that among all such numbers the "very beautiful number" is minimal possible.
The teachers' office isn't near and the teacher isn't young. But we've passed the test and we deserved the right to see the "very beautiful number". Help to restore the justice, find the "very beautiful number" for us!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The single line contains integers $ p $ , $ x $ ( $ 1<=p<=10^{6},1<=x<=9 $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If the teacher's made a mistake and such number doesn't exist, then print on a single line "Impossible" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print the "very beautiful number" without leading zeroes.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Sample 1: $ 142857·5=714285 $ .
Sample 2: The number that consists of a single digit cannot stay what it is when multiplied by 2, thus, the answer to the test sample is "Impossible".</div>
