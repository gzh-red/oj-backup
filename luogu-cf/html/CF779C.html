<h1>Dishonest Sellers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Igor发现一个商店的减价活动，他想要买n件物品。减价活动会持续一个星期。Igor知道现在每件物品的价格是ai,并且知道在一星期后价格会变为bi。
并不是所有的卖家都实诚，一星期后，有些商品的价格甚至会比现在的价格还便宜！
Igor决定现在最少买k件物品，然后等一个星期来省尽可能多的钱。你的任务就是用最少的钱买下这n件物品</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Igor found out discounts in a shop and decided to buy $ n $ items. Discounts at the store will last for a week and Igor knows about each item that its price now is $ a_{i} $ , and after a week of discounts its price will be $ b_{i} $ .
Not all of sellers are honest, so now some products could be more expensive than after a week of discounts.
Igor decided that buy at least $ k $ of items now, but wait with the rest of the week in order to save money as much as possible. Your task is to determine the minimum money that Igor can spend to buy all $ n $ items.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line there are two positive integer numbers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ , $ 0<=k<=n $ ) — total number of items to buy and minimal number of items Igor wants to by right now.
The second line contains sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{4} $ ) — prices of items during discounts (i.e. right now).
The third line contains sequence of integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ ( $ 1<=b_{i}<=10^{4} $ ) — prices of items after discounts (i.e. after a week).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimal amount of money Igor will spend to buy all $ n $ items. Remember, he should buy at least $ k $ items right now.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 1
5 4 6
3 1 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>10
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5 3
3 4 7 10 3
4 5 5 12 5
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>25
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example Igor should buy item 3 paying 6. But items 1 and 2 he should buy after a week. He will pay 3 and 1 for them. So in total he will pay $ 6+3+1=10 $ .
In the second example Igor should buy right now items 1, 2, 4 and 5, paying for them 3, 4, 10 and 3, respectively. Item 3 he should buy after a week of discounts, he will pay 5 for it. In total he will spend $ 3+4+10+3+5=25 $ .</div>
