<h1>Fish Weight</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>已知极地海洋中有k种鱼类，编号从1到k。它们按权重的非递减顺序排序，且是一个正数
北极熊爱丽丝和鲍勃各自抓了一些鱼，当给定这些数据和题设条件后要判断Alice的鱼的总重量是否能够比Bob的大。
说明：在这个例子中，令w1=1,w2=2,w3=2.5，即可使得w_Alice=6，w_Bob=4.5，所以此情况输出“YES”，否则输出“NO”.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is known that there are $ k $ fish species in the polar ocean, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ k $ . They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a positive number. Let the weight of the $ i $ -th type of fish be $ w_{i} $ , then $ 0&lt;w_{1}<=w_{2}<=...<=w_{k} $ holds.
Polar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's caught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weights $ w_{i} $ (not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n,m,k $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5},1<=k<=10^{9}) $ — the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively, and the number of fish species.
The second line contains $ n $ integers each from 1 to $ k $ , the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line contains $ m $ integers each from 1 to $ k $ , the list of fish type caught by Bob.
Note that one may have caught more than one fish for a same species.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 3 3
2 2 2
1 1 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>4 7 9
5 2 7 3
3 5 2 7 3 8 7
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, if $ w_{1}=1,w_{2}=2,w_{3}=2.5 $ , then Alice has a total of $ 2+2+2=6 $ weight units, while Bob only has $ 1+1+2.5=4.5 $ .
In the second sample, the fish that Alice caught is a subset of Bob's. Therefore, the total weight of Bob’s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice’s fish.</div>
