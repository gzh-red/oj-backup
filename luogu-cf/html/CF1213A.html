<h1>Chips Moving</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在数轴上有$n$个正整数，第$i$个数为$x_i$。有两种操作：
- $x_i$移动到$x_i-2$或$x_i+2$，不消耗硬币。
- $x_i$移动到$x_i-1$或$x_i+1$，消耗一枚硬币。
每个数都可以改变为任意大小的整数。
求所有数均改变为同一个数的最小消耗硬币数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given $ n $ chips on a number line. The $ i $ -th chip is placed at the integer coordinate $ x_i $ . Some chips can have equal coordinates.
You can perform each of the two following types of moves any (possibly, zero) number of times on any chip:
- Move the chip $ i $ by $ 2 $ to the left or $ 2 $ to the right for free (i.e. replace the current coordinate $ x_i $ with $ x_i - 2 $ or with $ x_i + 2 $ );
- move the chip $ i $ by $ 1 $ to the left or $ 1 $ to the right and pay one coin for this move (i.e. replace the current coordinate $ x_i $ with $ x_i - 1 $ or with $ x_i + 1 $ ).
Note that it's allowed to move chips to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.
Your task is to find the minimum total number of coins required to move all $ n $ chips to the same coordinate (i.e. all $ x_i $ should be equal after some sequence of moves).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the number of chips.
The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n $ ( $ 1 \le x_i \le 10^9 $ ), where $ x_i $ is the coordinate of the $ i $ -th chip.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the minimum total number of coins required to move all $ n $ chips to the same coordinate.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example you need to move the first chip by $ 2 $ to the right and the second chip by $ 1 $ to the right or move the third chip by $ 2 $ to the left and the second chip by $ 1 $ to the left so the answer is $ 1 $ .
In the second example you need to move two chips with coordinate $ 3 $ by $ 1 $ to the left so the answer is $ 2 $ .</div>
