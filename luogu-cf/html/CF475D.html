<h1>CGCDSSQ</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个长度为$n(1<=n<=10^{5})$ 的序列和$q(1<=q<=3*10^{5})$ 个询问,每个询问输出一行,询问$gcd(a_l,a_{l+1},...,a_r)=x$ 的$(i,j)$ 的对数.
感谢@凌幽 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a sequence of integers $ a_{1},...,a_{n} $ and $ q $ queries $ x_{1},...,x_{q} $ on it. For each query $ x_{i} $ you have to count the number of pairs $ (l,r) $ such that $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ and $ gcd(a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r})=x_{i} $ .
