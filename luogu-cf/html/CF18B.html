<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述：在一坐标轴上给出n块板子，每个板子所占的空间为[(k-1)m,(k-1)m+l]（l<m）,一个青蛙从原点0起跳，每次跳d距离远，问最后青蛙会落在哪里（没落在板子上就结束跳跃） 输入：一行四个整数n，d，m，l 输出：一个整数，即青蛙最后的落点 1<=n,d,m,l<=10^6 l<m Translated by 稀神探女</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In one one-dimensional world there are $ n $ platforms. Platform with index $ k $ (platforms are numbered from 1) is a segment with coordinates $ [(k-1)m,(k-1)m+l] $ , and $ l<m $ . Grasshopper Bob starts to jump along the platforms from point $ 0 $ , with each jump he moves exactly $ d $ units right. Find out the coordinate of the point, where Bob will fall down. The grasshopper falls down, if he finds himself not on the platform, but if he finds himself on the edge of the platform, he doesn't fall down.</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first input line contains 4 integer numbers $ n $ , $ d $ , $ m $ , $ l $ ( $ 1<=n,d,m,l<=10^{6},l<m $ ) — respectively: amount of platforms, length of the grasshopper Bob's jump, and numbers $ m $ and $ l $ needed to find coordinates of the $ k $ -th platform: $ [(k-1)m,(k-1)m+l] $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the coordinates of the point, where the grosshopper will fall down. Don't forget that if Bob finds himself on the platform edge, he doesn't fall down.</div>
