<h1>Jamie and Interesting Graph</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定n个点m条边
要求构造一张图，满足以下条件
>1.包含n个点，m条边
> 2.边权范围在[1,10^9]
> 3.1到n的最短路径长度是质数
> 4.最小生成树的边权和是质数
> 5.没有重边和自环</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jamie has recently found undirected weighted graphs with the following properties very interesting:
- The graph is connected and contains exactly $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges.
- All edge weights are integers and are in range $ [1,10^{9}] $ inclusive.
- The length of shortest path from $ 1 $ to $ n $ is a prime number.
- The sum of edges' weights in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph is a prime number.
- The graph contains no loops or multi-edges.
If you are not familiar with some terms from the statement you can find definitions of them in notes section.
Help Jamie construct any graph with given number of vertices and edges that is interesting!

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains 2 integers $ n $ , $ m $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916C/2d5925c368d31be87894bfaeb81a5671f57414c2.png) — the required number of vertices and edges.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line output 2 integers $ sp $ , $ mstw $ $ (1<=sp,mstw<=10^{14}) $ — the length of the shortest path and the sum of edges' weights in the minimum spanning tree.
In the next $ m $ lines output the edges of the graph. In each line output 3 integers $ u $ , $ v $ , $ w $ $ (1<=u,v<=n,1<=w<=10^{9}) $ describing the edge connecting $ u $ and $ v $ and having weight $ w $ .</div>

Definition of terms used in the problem statement:
A shortest path in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices $ (v_{1},v_{2},...\ ,v_{k}) $ such that $ v_{i} $ is adjacent to $ v_{i+1} $ $ 1<=i<k $ and the sum of weight ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF916C/df0334815830e4f0c8788e37a58a6247ba52744b.png) is minimized where $ w(i,j) $ is the edge weight between $ i $ and $ j $ . ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest\_path\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)) A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime\_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)) A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
