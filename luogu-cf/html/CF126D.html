<h1>Fibonacci Sums</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>计算一个整数被分解成若干个各不相等的Fibonacci数列中的数的方案； 每个测试点有多个数据； 输入：第一行有一个整数n，n<=1e5，之后第2行至第n+1行每行一个整数。表示需要计算被分解的方案的整数；每个整数的范围均属于[1,1e18]; 输出：共n行，每行一个整数，表示对应的整数被分解的方案总数

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fibonacci numbers have the following form:
$ F_{1}=1, $ $ F_{2}=2, $ $ F_{i}=F_{i-1}+F_{i-2},i>2. $ Let's consider some non-empty set $ S={s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k}} $ , consisting of different Fibonacci numbers. Let's find the sum of values of this set's elements:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF126D/5ab7141541105d7a2a0738fb86760948628a7a20.png)Let's call the set $ S $ a number $ n $ 's decomposition into Fibonacci sum.
It's easy to see that several numbers have several decompositions into Fibonacci sum. For example, for $ 13 $ we have $ 13,5+8,2+3+8 $ — three decompositions, and for $ 16 $ : $ 3+13,1+2+13,3+5+8,1+2+5+8 $ — four decompositions.
By the given number $ n $ determine the number of its possible different decompositions into Fibonacci sum.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ t $ — the number of tests ( $ 1<=t<=10^{5} $ ). Each of the following $ t $ lines contains one test.
Each test is an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{18} $ ).
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input data test print a single number on a single line — the answer to the problem.</div>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Two decompositions are different if there exists a number that is contained in the first decomposition, but is not contained in the second one. Decompositions that differ only in the order of summands are considered equal.</div>
