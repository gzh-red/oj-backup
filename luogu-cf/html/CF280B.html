<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目大意：
给出一个长为n的正整数序列。定义一个序列的所有数异或的结果为该式子的价值。求在此序列的所有子串（即要求连续一段区间）中价值最大是多少。
输入：
第一行一个整数n($1≤n≤10^5$),表示序列长度。
第二行n个由空格隔开的正整数$s_i$(($1≤s_i≤10^9$))，为序列元素。
输出仅一个整数，即最大异或和。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ $ (k&gt;1) $ is such maximum element $ x_{j} $ , that the following inequality holds: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF280B/cbffb592db1e3f6cc63c23bba8878833c080a3b3.png).
The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{k} $ $ (k&gt;1) $ is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.
You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ $ (n&gt;1) $ . Let's denote sequence $ s_{l},s_{l+1},...,s_{r} $ as $ s[l..r] $ $ (1<=l&lt;r<=n) $ . Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences $ s[l..r] $ .
Note that as all numbers in sequence $ s $ are distinct, all the given definitions make sence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1&lt;n<=10^{5}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ distinct integers $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ $ (1<=s_{i}<=10^{9}) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences $ s[l..r] $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For the first sample you can choose $ s[4..5]={4,3} $ and its lucky number is $ (4 xor 3)=7 $ . You can also choose $ s[1..2] $ .
For the second sample you must choose $ s[2..5]={8,3,5,7} $ .</div>
