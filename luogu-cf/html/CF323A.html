<h1>Black-and-White Cube</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个k×k×k大小的立方体，它由单位立方体组成。两个单元立方体如果有共同的面孔，就被认为是相邻的。你的任务是绘制两种颜色(黑色或白色)中的每一个k×k×k大小的单元立方体，这个立方体必须满足以下条件：
1. 每个白色立方体正好有两个相邻的白色立方体；
2.每个黑色立方体正好有两个相邻的黑色立方体。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a cube of size $ k×k×k $ , which consists of unit cubes. Two unit cubes are considered neighbouring, if they have common face.
Your task is to paint each of $ k^{3} $ unit cubes one of two colours (black or white), so that the following conditions must be satisfied:
- each white cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of white color;
- each black cube has exactly 2 neighbouring cubes of black color.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ k $ $ (1<=k<=100) $ , which is size of the cube.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print the required painting of the cube consequently by layers. Print a $ k×k $ matrix in the first $ k $ lines, showing how the first layer of the cube should be painted. In the following $ k $ lines print a $ k×k $ matrix — the way the second layer should be painted. And so on to the last $ k $ -th layer. Note that orientation of the cube in the space does not matter.
Mark a white unit cube with symbol "w" and a black one with "b". Use the format of output data, given in the test samples. You may print extra empty lines, they will be ignored.</div>
