<h1>Dima and Figure</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你需要从N*M的方格中选出一个连通的格子集，满足任意两个同行/列的集合内的格子之间的仍然是集合内的。求这样的集合个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dima loves making pictures on a piece of squared paper. And yet more than that Dima loves the pictures that depict one of his favorite figures.
A piece of squared paper of size $ n×m $ is represented by a table, consisting of $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. All squares are white on blank squared paper. Dima defines a picture as an image on a blank piece of paper, obtained by painting some squares black.
The picture portrays one of Dima's favorite figures, if the following conditions hold:
- The picture contains at least one painted cell;
- All painted cells form a connected set, that is, you can get from any painted cell to any other one (you can move from one cell to a side-adjacent one);
- The minimum number of moves needed to go from the painted cell at coordinates $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ to the painted cell at coordinates $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ , moving only through the colored cells, equals $ |x_{1}-x_{2}|+|y_{1}-y_{2}| $ .
Now Dima is wondering: how many paintings are on an $ n×m $ piece of paper, that depict one of his favorite figures? Count this number modulo $ 1000000007 (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ — the sizes of the piece of paper $ (1<=n,m<=150) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
