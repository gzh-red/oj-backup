<h1>Eight Point Sets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入8个点的坐标，如果这八个点是由三个不同的横坐标和三个不同的纵坐标任意组合而成的9个点中的外围8个点，输出 "respectable"，否则输出"ugly"。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Gerald is very particular to eight point sets. He thinks that any decent eight point set must consist of all pairwise intersections of three distinct integer vertical straight lines and three distinct integer horizontal straight lines, except for the average of these nine points. In other words, there must be three integers $ x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} $ and three more integers $ y_{1},y_{2},y_{3} $ , such that $ x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;x_{3} $ , $ y_{1}&lt;y_{2}&lt;y_{3} $ and the eight point set consists of all points $ (x_{i},y_{j}) $ ( $ 1<=i,j<=3 $ ), except for point $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ .
You have a set of eight points. Find out if Gerald can use this set?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of eight lines, the $ i $ -th line contains two space-separated integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 0<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{6} $ ). You do not have any other conditions for these points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print word "respectable", if the given set of points corresponds to Gerald's decency rules, and "ugly" otherwise.</div>
