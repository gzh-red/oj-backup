<h1>Nested Segments</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of one-dimensional segments numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ . Your task is to find two distinct indices $ i $ and $ j $ such that segment $ a_{i} $ lies within segment $ a_{j} $ .
Segment $ [l_{1},r_{1}] $ lies within segment $ [l_{2},r_{2}] $ iff $ l_{1}>=l_{2} $ and $ r_{1}<=r_{2} $ .
Print indices $ i $ and $ j $ . If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no answer exists, print -1 -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of segments.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the $ i $ -th segment.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print two distinct indices $ i $ and $ j $ such that segment $ a_{i} $ lies within segment $ a_{j} $ . If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no answer exists, print -1 -1.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example the following pairs are considered correct:
- $ (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1) $ — not even touching borders;
- $ (3,2),(4,2),(3,5),(4,5) $ — touch one border;
- $ (5,2),(2,5) $ — match exactly.</div>
