<h1>Sereja and Bottles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Sereja有n个瓶子，第i个瓶子是$a_{i}$类的，用这个瓶子可以打开$b_{i}$类的瓶子，无论瓶子有没有打开，它都可以用来打开其他瓶子，求有几个瓶子无法打开</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sereja and his friends went to a picnic. The guys had $ n $ soda bottles just for it. Sereja forgot the bottle opener as usual, so the guys had to come up with another way to open bottles.
Sereja knows that the $ i $ -th bottle is from brand $ a_{i} $ , besides, you can use it to open other bottles of brand $ b_{i} $ . You can use one bottle to open multiple other bottles. Sereja can open bottle with opened bottle or closed bottle.
Knowing this, Sereja wants to find out the number of bottles they've got that they won't be able to open in any way. Help him and find this number.</div>
