<h1>The Fraction【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Periodic decimal fraction is usually written as: \[entire\_part.non-periodic\_part (period)\]. Any simple fraction can be represented as a periodic decimal fraction and vice versa. For example, the decimal fraction $ 0.2(45) $ corresponds to a fraction $ 27/110 $ . Your task is to convert the periodic fraction to a simple periodic fraction.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the periodic decimal fraction $ x $ ( $ 0&lt;x&lt;1 $ ) in the format described in the statement. The total number of digits in the period and non-periodic part of the fraction does not exceed 8. Non-periodic part may be absent, the periodic part can't be absent (but it can be equal to any non-negative number).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the representation of the fraction $ x $ as a simple fraction $ p/q $ , where $ p $ and $ q $ are mutually prime integers.</div>
