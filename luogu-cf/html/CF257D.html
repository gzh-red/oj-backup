<h1>Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vasya has found a piece of paper with an array written on it. The array consists of $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Vasya noticed that the following condition holds for the array $ a_{i}<=a_{i+1}<=2·a_{i} $ for any positive integer $ i $ ( $ i&lt;n $ ).
Vasya wants to add either a "+" or a "-" before each number of array. Thus, Vasya will get an expression consisting of $ n $ summands. The value of the resulting expression is the sum of all its elements. The task is to add signs "+" and "-" before each number so that the value of expression $ s $ meets the limits $ 0<=s<=a_{1} $ . Print a sequence of signs "+" and "-", satisfying the given limits. It is guaranteed that the solution for the problem exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the original array.
It is guaranteed that the condition $ a_{i}<=a_{i+1}<=2·a_{i} $ fulfills for any positive integer $ i $ ( $ i&lt;n $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print the sequence of $ n $ characters "+" and "-", where the $ i $ -th character is the sign that is placed in front of number $ a_{i} $ . The value of the resulting expression $ s $ must fit into the limits $ 0<=s<=a_{1} $ . If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.</div>
