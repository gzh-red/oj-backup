<h1>Maxim and Increasing Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个长度为$n$的$B$数组,$A$表示$B$数组复制$t$遍后首尾相连后的数组,求$A$的最长上升子序列 有$k$组询问 $maxb$表示$B$数组中最大的数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Maxim loves sequences, especially those that strictly increase. He is wondering, what is the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the given sequence $ a $ ?
Sequence $ a $ is given as follows:
- the length of the sequence equals $ n×t $ ;
- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF261D/62550b81a494c59fe3493af08329ebf8f9d7bb9b.png) $ (1<=i<=n×t) $ , where operation ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF261D/946bcc44e053027f1f6b5dfc3143583e661988f5.png) means taking the remainder after dividing number $ x $ by number $ y $ .
Sequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{r} $ of length $ r $ is a subsequence of sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ , if there is such increasing sequence of indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{r} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...\ &lt;i_{r}<=n) $ , that $ a_{ij}=s_{j} $ . In other words, the subsequence can be obtained from the sequence by crossing out some elements.
Sequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{r} $ is increasing, if the following inequality holds: $ s_{1}&lt;s_{2}&lt;...&lt;s_{r} $ .
Maxim have $ k $ variants of the sequence $ a $ . Help Maxim to determine for each sequence the length of the longest increasing subsequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains four integers $ k $ , $ n $ , $ maxb $ and $ t $ $ (1<=k<=10; 1<=n,maxb<=10^{5}; 1<=t<=10^{9}; n×maxb<=2·10^{7}) $ . Each of the next $ k $ lines contain $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=maxb) $ .
Note that for each variant of the sequence $ a $ the values $ n $ , $ maxb $ and $ t $ coincide, the only arrays $ b $ s differ.
The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print $ k $ integers — the answers for the variants of the sequence $ a $ . Print the answers in the order the variants follow in the input.</div>
