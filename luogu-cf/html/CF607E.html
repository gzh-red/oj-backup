<h1>Cross Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Genos has been given $ n $ distinct lines on the Cartesian plane. Let ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/828bd1f150735aa8c65c79525d1418ab3058d668.png) be a list of intersection points of these lines. A single point might appear multiple times in this list if it is the intersection of multiple pairs of lines. The order of the list does not matter.
Given a query point $ (p,q) $ , let ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/887c79cacd151e1b1341a67c48b05ad1977a6a94.png) be the corresponding list of distances of all points in ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/828bd1f150735aa8c65c79525d1418ab3058d668.png) to the query point. Distance here refers to euclidean distance. As a refresher, the euclidean distance between two points $ (x_{1},y_{1}) $ and $ (x_{2},y_{2}) $ is ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/86b2aa253cbc7f8f2ad97ad58bb4a22991d5ff81.png).
Genos is given a point $ (p,q) $ and a positive integer $ m $ . He is asked to find the sum of the $ m $ smallest elements in ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/887c79cacd151e1b1341a67c48b05ad1977a6a94.png). Duplicate elements in ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/887c79cacd151e1b1341a67c48b05ad1977a6a94.png) are treated as separate elements. Genos is intimidated by Div1 E problems so he asked for your help.</div>

<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=50000 $ ) — the number of lines.
The second line contains three integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ m $ ( $ |x|,|y|<=1000000 $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/8201e41b76d5859818b53fa92521eb060190c840.png)) — the encoded coordinates of the query point and the integer $ m $ from the statement above. The query point $ (p,q) $ is obtained as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/ab5ed9d2a6b0c9e268daea47ead56f0338fbfe18.png). In other words, divide $ x $ and $ y $ by $ 1000 $ to get the actual query point. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/10e260f8817511999fbd109fdb87fbea4e756803.png) denotes the length of the list ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/887c79cacd151e1b1341a67c48b05ad1977a6a94.png) and it is guaranteed that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/ee6d034e06de3830b228a5cd59532bc52e9dfb32.png).
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ |a_{i}|,|b_{i}|<=1000000 $ ) — the parameters for a line of the form: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/ea08f1eff68d58992a22c15cbd8926ac7afc12c5.png). It is guaranteed that no two lines are the same, that is $ (a_{i},b_{i})≠(a_{j},b_{j}) $ if $ i≠j $ .</div>

<div>Print a single real number, the sum of $ m $ smallest elements of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/887c79cacd151e1b1341a67c48b05ad1977a6a94.png). Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .
To clarify, let's assume that your answer is $ a $ and the answer of the jury is $ b $ . The checker program will consider your answer correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/c5d4f85807f95b08a3db7aae534822038a5bf1df.png).</div>

<div>In the first sample, the three closest points have distances ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/03e1c4be79c9981c15945694583ed8d2e2085b66.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/d62dafca248b736710e5c1ac832c2ae727a7ca37.png).
In the second sample, the two lines $ y=1000x-1000 $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/faf029c89031cc072ce6f3860dca6bca047834e2.png) intersect at $ (2000000,1999999000) $ . This point has a distance of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/e834978c95cd4c06fee17dcf9f08db5c1d7a9312.png) from $ (-1000,-1000) $ .
In the third sample, the three lines all intersect at the point $ (1,1) $ . This intersection point is present three times in ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF607E/828bd1f150735aa8c65c79525d1418ab3058d668.png) since it is the intersection of three pairs of lines. Since the distance between the intersection point and the query point is $ 2 $ , the answer is three times that or $ 6 $ .</div>
