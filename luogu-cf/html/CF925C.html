<h1>Big Secret</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer sequence $ a_1, \ldots, a_n $ . In order to not reveal the secret earlier than needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence $ b_1, \ldots, b_n $ using the following rules:
- $ b_1 = a_1 $ ;
- $ b_i = a_i \oplus a_{i - 1} $ for all $ i $ from 2 to $ n $ , where $ x \oplus y $ is the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of $ x $ and $ y $ .
It is easy to see that the original sequence can be obtained using the rule $ a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i $ .
However, some time later Vitya discovered that the integers $ b_i $ in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when decrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is not increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community, Vasya decided to find some permutation of integers $ b_i $ so that the sequence $ a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i $ is strictly increasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is impossible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $ ).
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ b_1, \ldots, b_n $ ( $ 1 \leq b_i < 2^{60} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there are no valid permutations, print a single line containing "No".
Otherwise in the first line print the word "Yes", and in the second line print integers $ b'_1, \ldots, b'_n $ — a valid permutation of integers $ b_i $ . The unordered multisets $ \{b_1, \ldots, b_n\} $ and $ \{b'_1, \ldots, b'_n\} $ should be equal, i. e. for each integer $ x $ the number of occurrences of $ x $ in the first multiset should be equal to the number of occurrences of $ x $ in the second multiset. Apart from this, the sequence $ a_i = b'_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b'_i $ should be strictly increasing.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example no permutation is valid.
In the second example the given answer lead to the sequence $ a_1 = 4 $ , $ a_2 = 8 $ , $ a_3 = 15 $ , $ a_4 = 16 $ , $ a_5 = 23 $ , $ a_6 = 42 $ .</div>
