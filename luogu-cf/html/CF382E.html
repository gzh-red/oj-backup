<h1>Ksenia and Combinatorics</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一棵?个节点的树，标号从1到?。
除了1号节点至多与另外2个节点连边，其余至多与另外3个节点连边。
两个树是相同的，当且仅每个节点的相连节点都相同。
求有多少种不同的这样的树，满足最大匹配为$k$
，答案对$1e9+7$取膜
一行读入两数，分别为$n,k$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ksenia has her winter exams. Today she is learning combinatorics. Here's one of the problems she needs to learn to solve.
How many distinct trees are there consisting of $ n $ vertices, each with the following properties:
- the tree is marked, that is, the vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to $ n $ ;
- each vertex of the tree is connected with at most three other vertices, and at the same moment the vertex with number 1 is connected with at most two other vertices;
- the size of the tree's maximum matching equals $ k $ .
Two trees are considered distinct if there are such two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ , that in one tree they are connected by an edge and in the other tree they are not.
Help Ksenia solve the problem for the given $ n $ and $ k $ . As the answer to the problem can be very huge you should output it modulo $ 1000000007 (10^{9}+7) $ .</div>
