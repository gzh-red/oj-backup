<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are $ n $ benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that $ a_i $ people are currently sitting on the $ i $ -th bench. Another $ m $ people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of $ n $ available.
Let $ k $ be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $ m $ people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible $ k $ and the maximum possible $ k $ .
Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ n $ $ (1 \le n \le 100) $ — the number of benches in the park.
The second line contains a single integer $ m $ $ (1 \le m \le 10\,000) $ — the number of people additionally coming to the park.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a single integer $ a_i $ $ (1 \le a_i \le 100) $ — the initial number of people on the $ i $ -th bench.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the minimum possible $ k $ and the maximum possible $ k $ , where $ k $ is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional $ m $ people came to the park.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum $ k $ is $ 3 $ . For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum $ k $ is $ 7 $ . That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.
The second example has its minimum $ k $ equal to $ 15 $ and maximum $ k $ equal to $ 15 $ , as there is just a single bench in the park and all $ 10 $ people will occupy it.</div>
