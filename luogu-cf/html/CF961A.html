<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n,m$和$m$个数$a_1\dots a_m$
求$[1,n]$在$a_1\dots a_m$中出现次数最少的数的出现次数
感谢@huhao 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a following process.
There is a platform with $ n $ columns. $ 1 \times 1 $ squares are appearing one after another in some columns on this platform. If there are no squares in the column, a square will occupy the bottom row. Otherwise a square will appear at the top of the highest square of this column.
When all of the $ n $ columns have at least one square in them, the bottom row is being removed. You will receive $ 1 $ point for this, and all the squares left will fall down one row.
You task is to calculate the amount of points you will receive.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contain 2 integer numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 1000 $ ) — the length of the platform and the number of the squares.
The next line contain $ m $ integer numbers $ c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m $ ( $ 1 \le c_i \le n $ ) — column in which $ i $ -th square will appear.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the amount of points you will receive.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 9
1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the sample case the answer will be equal to $ 2 $ because after the appearing of $ 6 $ -th square will be removed one row (counts of the squares on the platform will look like $ [2~ 3~ 1] $ , and after removing one row will be $ [1~ 2~ 0] $ ).
After the appearing of $ 9 $ -th square counts will be $ [2~ 3~ 1] $ , and after removing one row it will look like $ [1~ 2~ 0] $ .
So the answer will be equal to $ 2 $ .</div>
