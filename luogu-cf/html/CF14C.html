<h1>Four Segments</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出四条线段的起点，终点坐标，四条线段平行或垂直坐标轴，问这四条线段能否构成矩形
橫，纵坐标的绝对值绝不超过10^9
感谢 @稀神探女 提供的翻译。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Several months later Alex finally got his brother Bob's creation by post. And now, in his turn, Alex wants to boast about something to his brother. He thought for a while, and came to the conclusion that he has no ready creations, and decided to write a program for rectangles detection. According to his plan, the program detects if the four given segments form a rectangle of a positive area and with sides parallel to coordinate axes. As Alex does badly at school and can't write this program by himself, he asks you to help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input data contain four lines. Each of these lines contains four integers $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{9} $ ) — coordinates of segment's beginning and end positions. The given segments can degenerate into points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the word «YES», if the given four segments form the required rectangle, otherwise output «NO».</div>
