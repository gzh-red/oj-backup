<h1>A Twisty Movement</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个序列 A，你可以翻转其中的一个区间内的数，求翻转后的序列的最长不下降子序列的长度。（$|A|\le 2000,1\le a_i \le 2$ ）
感谢@touristWang 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A dragon symbolizes wisdom, power and wealth. On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.
A performer holding the rod low is represented by a $ 1 $ , while one holding it high is represented by a $ 2 $ . Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ .
Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval $ [l,r] $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ), then reverse $ a_{l},a_{l+1},...,a_{r} $ so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.
A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ , such that $ p_{1}<p_{2}<...<p_{k} $ and $ a_{p1}<=a_{p2}<=...<=a_{pk} $ . The length of the subsequence is $ k $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=2000) $ , denoting the length of the original sequence.
The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers, describing the original sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=2,i=1,2,...,n) $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
1 2 1 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>10
1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>9
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example, after reversing $ [2,3] $ , the array will become $ [1,1,2,2] $ , where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is $ 4 $ .
In the second example, after reversing $ [3,7] $ , the array will become $ [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1] $ , where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is $ 9 $ .</div>
