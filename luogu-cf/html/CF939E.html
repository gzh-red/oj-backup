<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于一个只包含正整数的multiset S，你需要支持以下2种操作：
1. 加入一个新数x到S中，满足加入的数是递增的;
2. 找出S的一个子集s，使其max(s)-mean(s)最大，并输出这个最大之。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a multiset $ S $ consisting of positive integers (initially empty). There are two kind of queries:
1. Add a positive integer to $ S $ , the newly added integer is not less than any number in it.
2. Find a subset $ s $ of the set $ S $ such that the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF939E/6f55d1af0b4bb2f506e26b52edc60c22c6c89cc4.png) is maximum possible. Here $ max(s) $ means maximum value of elements in $ s $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF939E/41a32d216cf052c5a047afb797c2b693c1941a38.png) — the average value of numbers in $ s $ . Output this maximum possible value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF939E/6f55d1af0b4bb2f506e26b52edc60c22c6c89cc4.png).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer $ Q $ ( $ 1<=Q<=5·10^{5} $ ) — the number of queries.
Each of the next $ Q $ lines contains a description of query. For queries of type $ 1 $ two integers $ 1 $ and $ x $ are given, where $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=10^{9} $ ) is a number that you should add to $ S $ . It's guaranteed that $ x $ is not less than any number in $ S $ . For queries of type $ 2 $ , a single integer $ 2 $ is given.
It's guaranteed that the first query has type $ 1 $ , i. e. $ S $ is not empty when a query of type $ 2 $ comes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the answer for each query of the second type in the order these queries are given in input. Each number should be printed in separate line.
Your answer is considered correct, if each of your answers has absolute or relative error not greater than $ 10^{-6} $ .
Formally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ . Your answer is considered correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF939E/ff5435bf79eb188c9b35e530805de6ccf12620f2.png).</div>
