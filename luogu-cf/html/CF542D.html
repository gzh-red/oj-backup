<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It's tough to be a superhero. And it's twice as tough to resist the supervillain who is cool at math. Suppose that you're an ordinary Batman in an ordinary city of Gotham. Your enemy Joker mined the building of the city administration and you only have several minutes to neutralize the charge. To do that you should enter the cancel code on the bomb control panel.
However, that mad man decided to give you a hint. This morning the mayor found a playing card under his pillow. There was a line written on the card:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF542D/f25c27119b9129d1acec4b8a6f6b5ce705658eca.png)The bomb has a note saying " $ J(x)=A $ ", where $ A $ is some positive integer. You suspect that the cancel code is some integer $ x $ that meets the equation $ J(x)=A $ . Now in order to decide whether you should neutralize the bomb or run for your life, you've got to count how many distinct positive integers $ x $ meet this equation.</div>

In the first sample test the only suitable value of $ x $ is $ 2 $ . Then $ J(2)=1+2 $ .
In the second sample test the following values of $ x $ match:
- $ x=14 $ , $ J(14)=1+2+7+14=24 $
- $ x=15 $ , $ J(15)=1+3+5+15=24 $
- $ x=23 $ , $ J(23)=1+23=24 $</div>
