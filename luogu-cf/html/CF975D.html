<h1>Ghosts</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ghosts live in harmony and peace, they travel the space without any purpose other than scare whoever stands in their way.
There are $ n $ ghosts in the universe, they move in the $ OXY $ plane, each one of them has its own velocity that does not change in time: $ \overrightarrow{V} = V_{x}\overrightarrow{i} + V_{y}\overrightarrow{j} $ where $ V_{x} $ is its speed on the $ x $ -axis and $ V_{y} $ is on the $ y $ -axis.
A ghost $ i $ has experience value $ EX_i $ , which represent how many ghosts tried to scare him in his past. Two ghosts scare each other if they were in the same cartesian point at a moment of time.
As the ghosts move with constant speed, after some moment of time there will be no further scaring (what a relief!) and the experience of ghost kind $ GX = \sum_{i=1}^{n} EX_i $ will never increase.
Tameem is a red giant, he took a picture of the cartesian plane at a certain moment of time $ T $ , and magically all the ghosts were aligned on a line of the form $ y = a \cdot x + b $ . You have to compute what will be the experience index of the ghost kind $ GX $ in the indefinite future, this is your task for today.
Note that when Tameem took the picture, $ GX $ may already be greater than $ 0 $ , because many ghosts may have scared one another at any moment between $ [-\infty, T] $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers $ n $ , $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 200000 $ , $ 1 \leq |a| \leq 10^9 $ , $ 0 \le |b| \le 10^9 $ ) — the number of ghosts in the universe and the parameters of the straight line.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains three integers $ x_i $ , $ V_{xi} $ , $ V_{yi} $ ( $ -10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9 $ , $ -10^9 \leq V_{x i}, V_{y i} \leq 10^9 $ ), where $ x_i $ is the current $ x $ -coordinate of the $ i $ -th ghost (and $ y_i = a \cdot x_i + b $ ).
It is guaranteed that no two ghosts share the same initial position, in other words, it is guaranteed that for all $ (i,j) $ $ x_i \neq x_j $ for $ i \ne j $ .</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There are four collisions $ (1,2,T-0.5) $ , $ (1,3,T-1) $ , $ (2,4,T+1) $ , $ (3,4,T+0.5) $ , where $ (u,v,t) $ means a collision happened between ghosts $ u $ and $ v $ at moment $ t $ . At each collision, each ghost gained one experience point, this means that $ GX = 4 \cdot 2 = 8 $ .
In the second test, all points will collide when $ t = T + 1 $ .
