<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
zyk办了一个工厂，里面是流水线作业。
已知一条流水线有n个货物要装载，依次过来货物的容量是a1, a2, …, an，如果货物容量超过b，为不合格货物，不装载，丢弃。
装载货物的箱子容量为d，可以一直装载流水线过来的合格货物，直到超过容量d时，做一次特殊的压缩处理，然后封装，之后换新的箱子继续如此安装。
zyk想知道这条流水线总共做了多少次特殊的压缩处理。
样例中有两个不超过7的货物过来，做一次特殊的压缩处理即可。
输入
第一行输入n,b,d
第二行输入n个整数ai
输出
输出做了多少次特殊的压缩处理
样例输入
2 7 10

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kolya is going to make fresh orange juice. He has $ n $ oranges of sizes $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . Kolya will put them in the juicer in the fixed order, starting with orange of size $ a_{1} $ , then orange of size $ a_{2} $ and so on. To be put in the juicer the orange must have size not exceeding $ b $ , so if Kolya sees an orange that is strictly greater he throws it away and continues with the next one.
The juicer has a special section to collect waste. It overflows if Kolya squeezes oranges of the total size strictly greater than $ d $ . When it happens Kolya empties the waste section (even if there are no more oranges) and continues to squeeze the juice. How many times will he have to empty the waste section?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ b $ and $ d $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ , $ 1<=b<=d<=1000000 $ ) — the number of oranges, the maximum size of the orange that fits in the juicer and the value $ d $ , which determines the condition when the waste section should be emptied.
The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=1000000 $ ) — sizes of the oranges listed in the order Kolya is going to try to put them in the juicer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print one integer — the number of times Kolya will have to empty the waste section.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, Kolya will squeeze the juice from two oranges and empty the waste section afterwards.
In the second sample, the orange won't fit in the juicer so Kolya will have no juice at all.</div>
