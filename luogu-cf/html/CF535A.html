<h1>Tavas and Nafas</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：输入一个1-99的整数，转化成英文的写法，比如9->nine</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.
His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words.
