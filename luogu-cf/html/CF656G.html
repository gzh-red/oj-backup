<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在你要为一个推荐系统写一个程序。这个推荐系统通过目标人员的朋友的喜好对他的喜好进行推断。这个人有F个朋友，系统有I个物品可被推荐。现在你已经获得了这F个人对所有I个物品的看法，输入的矩阵中，若(i,j)上的字符为'Y'则代表第i个人喜好第j个物品，反之亦然。请输出至少有T个人喜好的物品数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A simple recommendation system would recommend a user things liked by a certain number of their friends. In this problem you will implement part of such a system.
You are given user's friends' opinions about a list of items. You are also given a threshold $ T $ — the minimal number of "likes" necessary for an item to be recommended to the user.
Output the number of items in the list liked by at least $ T $ of user's friends.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input will contain three space-separated integers: the number of friends $ F $ ( $ 1<=F<=10 $ ), the number of items $ I $ ( $ 1<=I<=10 $ ) and the threshold $ T $ ( $ 1<=T<=F $ ).
The following $ F $ lines of input contain user's friends' opinions. $ j $ -th character of $ i $ -th line is 'Y' if $ i $ -th friend likes $ j $ -th item, and 'N' otherwise.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
