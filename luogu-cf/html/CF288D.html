<h1>Polo the Penguin and Trees </h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little penguin Polo has got a tree — a non-directed connected acyclic graph, containing $ n $ nodes and $ n-1 $ edges. We will consider the tree nodes numbered by integers from 1 to $ n $ .
Today Polo wonders, how to find the number of pairs of paths that don't have common nodes. More formally, he should find the number of groups of four integers $ a,b,c $ and $ d $ such that:
- $ 1<=a&lt;b<=n $ ;
- $ 1<=c&lt;d<=n $ ;
- there's no such node that lies on both the shortest path from node $ a $ to node $ b $ and from node $ c $ to node $ d $ .
The shortest path betweem two nodes is the path that is shortest in the number of edges.
Help Polo solve this problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=80000) $ — the number of tree nodes. Each of the following $ n-1 $ lines contains a pair of integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ $ (1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n; u_{i}≠v_{i}) $ — the $ i $ -th edge of the tree.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is recommended to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.</div>
