<h1>Unusual Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan on his birthday was presented with array of non-negative integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ . He immediately noted that all $ a_i $ satisfy the condition $ 0 \leq a_i \leq 15 $ .
Ivan likes graph theory very much, so he decided to transform his sequence to the graph.
There will be $ n $ vertices in his graph, and vertices $ u $ and $ v $ will present in the graph if and only if binary notations of integers $ a_u $ and $ a_v $ are differ in exactly one bit (in other words, $ a_u \oplus a_v = 2^k $ for some integer $ k \geq 0 $ . Where $ \oplus $ is [Bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)).
A terrible thing happened in a couple of days, Ivan forgot his sequence $ a $ , and all that he remembers is constructed graph!
Can you help him, and find any sequence $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ , such that graph constructed by the same rules that Ivan used will be the same as his graph?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contain two integers $ n,m $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 500, 0 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2} $ ): number of vertices and edges in Ivan's graph.
Next $ m $ lines contain the description of edges: $ i $ -th line contain two integers $ u_i, v_i $ ( $ 1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n; u_i \neq v_i $ ), describing undirected edge connecting vertices $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ in the graph.
It is guaranteed that there are no multiple edges in the graph. It is guaranteed that there exists some solution for the given graph.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output $ n $ space-separated integers, $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 0 \leq a_i \leq 15 $ ).
Printed numbers should satisfy the constraints: edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ present in the graph if and only if $ a_u \oplus a_v = 2^k $ for some integer $ k \geq 0 $ .
It is guaranteed that there exists some solution for the given graph. If there are multiple possible solutions, you can output any.</div>
