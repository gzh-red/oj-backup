<h1>Fedor and coupons</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>我们所有的角色都有某些习惯。Fedor 也一样。他在邻近的超市享受购物。
超市的不同货物有不同的整数 ID。对于每个整数也有一个产品的 ID 和这个整数相同。Fedor 有 $n$ 张折扣券，它们中的第 $i$ 张可以用于 ID 范围介于 $[l_i, r_i]$ 的产品。今天 Fedor 想要携带恰好 $k$ 张折扣券。
Fedor 想要选择 $k$ 张折扣券，使得所有的折扣券都可以用于尽可能多的产品数目 $x$ (为了最好的理解，参见样例)。Fedor 同时也想节省时间，所以他请求你为他选择折扣券。请帮帮 Fedor！</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>All our characters have hobbies. The same is true for Fedor. He enjoys shopping in the neighboring supermarket.
The goods in the supermarket have unique integer ids. Also, for every integer there is a product with id equal to this integer. Fedor has $ n $ discount coupons, the $ i $ -th of them can be used with products with ids ranging from $ l_{i} $ to $ r_{i} $ , inclusive. Today Fedor wants to take exactly $ k $ coupons with him.
Fedor wants to choose the $ k $ coupons in such a way that the number of such products $ x $ that all coupons can be used with this product $ x $ is as large as possible (for better understanding, see examples). Fedor wants to save his time as well, so he asks you to choose coupons for him. Help Fedor!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=3·10^{5} $ ) — the number of coupons Fedor has, and the number of coupons he wants to choose.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the description of the $ i $ -th coupon. The coupons can be equal.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line print single integer — the maximum number of products with which all the chosen coupons can be used. The products with which at least one coupon cannot be used shouldn't be counted.
In the second line print $ k $ distinct integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<=n $ ) — the ids of the coupons which Fedor should choose.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first example if we take the first two coupons then all the products with ids in range $ [40,70] $ can be bought with both coupons. There are $ 31 $ products in total.
In the second example, no product can be bought with two coupons, that is why the answer is $ 0 $ . Fedor can choose any two coupons in this example.</div>
