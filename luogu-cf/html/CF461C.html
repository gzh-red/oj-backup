<h1>Appleman and a Sheet of Paper</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>苹果曼有很大的一张纸。这张纸的形状是1×n的长方形。你的任务是帮助苹果曼来折叠这一张纸。有一些操作，这些操作有如下两个种形式：
1.把这张纸在第pi个位置对折。经过对折后，左边的1×pi部分会盖到右边的1×(当前纸片宽度-pi)上面。
2.询问如果把距离左端li以内的剪掉，距离左端ri以外的也剪掉，那么还剩下多少纸片的长度。
看样例，可以更好的解理这个问题。
![](https://img.51nod.com/upload/000FBF13/08D2A8B5A43793C40000000000000006.png)
第一次折叠之后，纸片的宽度变成了4，第二次折叠，纸片的宽度变成了2。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Appleman has a very big sheet of paper. This sheet has a form of rectangle with dimensions $ 1×n $ . Your task is help Appleman with folding of such a sheet. Actually, you need to perform $ q $ queries. Each query will have one of the following types:
1. Fold the sheet of paper at position $ p_{i} $ . After this query the leftmost part of the paper with dimensions $ 1×p_{i} $ must be above the rightmost part of the paper with dimensions $ 1×([current width of sheet]-p_{i}) $ .
2. Count what is the total width of the paper pieces, if we will make two described later cuts and consider only the pieces between the cuts. We will make one cut at distance $ l_{i} $ from the left border of the current sheet of paper and the other at distance $ r_{i} $ from the left border of the current sheet of paper.
Please look at the explanation of the first test example for better understanding of the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers: $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5}; 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the width of the paper and the number of queries.
Each of the following $ q $ lines contains one of the described queries in the following format:
- " $ 1 $ $ p_{i} $ " $ (1<=p_{i}&lt;[current width of sheet]) $ — the first type query.
- " $ 2 $ $ l_{i} $ $ r_{i} $ " $ (0<=l_{i}&lt;r_{i}<=[current width of sheet]) $ — the second type query.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of the second type, output the answer.</div>
