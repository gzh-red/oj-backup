<h1>Ivan and Burgers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n$和$a_{i\dots n}$
有$q$个询问：
给定$l,r$
求在$a_{l\dots r}$中选取任意个，使得他们的异或和最大。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ivan loves burgers and spending money. There are $ n $ burger joints on the street where Ivan lives. Ivan has $ q $ friends, and the $ i $ -th friend suggested to meet at the joint $ l_i $ and walk to the joint $ r_i $ $ (l_i \leq r_i) $ . While strolling with the $ i $ -th friend Ivan can visit all joints $ x $ which satisfy $ l_i \leq x \leq r_i $ .
For each joint Ivan knows the cost of the most expensive burger in it, it costs $ c_i $ burles. Ivan wants to visit some subset of joints on his way, in each of them he will buy the most expensive burger and spend the most money. But there is a small issue: his card broke and instead of charging him for purchases, the amount of money on it changes as follows.
If Ivan had $ d $ burles before the purchase and he spent $ c $ burles at the joint, then after the purchase he would have $ d \oplus c $ burles, where $ \oplus $ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).
Currently Ivan has $ 2^{2^{100}} - 1 $ burles and he wants to go out for a walk. Help him to determine the maximal amount of burles he can spend if he goes for a walk with the friend $ i $ . The amount of burles he spends is defined as the difference between the initial amount on his account and the final account.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 500\,000 $ ) — the number of burger shops.
The next line contains $ n $ integers $ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n $ ( $ 0 \leq c_i \leq 10^6 $ ), where $ c_i $ — the cost of the most expensive burger in the burger joint $ i $ .
The third line contains one integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \leq q \leq 500\,000 $ ) — the number of Ivan's friends.
Each of the next $ q $ lines contain two integers $ l_i $ and $ r_i $ ( $ 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n $ ) — pairs of numbers of burger shops between which Ivan will walk.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first test, in order to spend the maximum amount of money with the first and third friends, Ivan just needs to go into the first burger. With a second friend, Ivan just go to the third burger.
In the second test for a third friend (who is going to walk from the first to the third burger), there are only 8 options to spend money — $ 0 $ , $ 12 $ , $ 14 $ , $ 23 $ , $ 12 \oplus 14 = 2 $ , $ 14 \oplus 23 = 25 $ , $ 12 \oplus 23 = 27 $ , $ 12 \oplus 14 \oplus 23 = 20 $ . The maximum amount of money it turns out to spend, if you go to the first and third burger — $ 12 \oplus 23 = 27 $ .</div>
