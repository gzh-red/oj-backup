<h1>Seat Arrangements</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
教室有n排座位，每排有m个座位，将教室表示为$n*m$ 的矩阵。字符'.'代表一个空座位，而'*'意味着座位被占用。你需要在同一行或同一列中找到k个连续的空席位，并为你和你的朋友安排这些座位。你的任务是找出安排座位的方式。如果学生所占据的地方不同，两种方式被认为是不同的。
# 输入格式
第一行n, m, k $(1\le n,m,k \le 2000)$
接下来一个n*m的矩阵。
# 输出格式
一个整数 表示不同的方案数

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Suppose that you are in a campus and have to go for classes day by day. As you may see, when you hurry to a classroom, you surprisingly find that many seats there are already occupied. Today you and your friends went for class, and found out that some of the seats were occupied.
The classroom contains $ n $ rows of seats and there are $ m $ seats in each row. Then the classroom can be represented as an $ n×m $ matrix. The character '.' represents an empty seat, while '\*' means that the seat is occupied. You need to find $ k $ consecutive empty seats in the same row or column and arrange those seats for you and your friends. Your task is to find the number of ways to arrange the seats. Two ways are considered different if sets of places that students occupy differs.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three positive integers $ n,m,k $ ( $ 1<=n,m,k<=2000 $ ), where $ n,m $ represent the sizes of the classroom and $ k $ is the number of consecutive seats you need to find.
Each of the next $ n $ lines contains $ m $ characters '.' or '\*'. They form a matrix representing the classroom, '.' denotes an empty seat, and '\*' denotes an occupied seat.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single number, denoting the number of ways to find $ k $ empty seats in the same row or column.</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the first sample, there are three ways to arrange those seats. You can take the following seats for your arrangement.
- $ (1,3) $ , $ (2,3) $
- $ (2,2) $ , $ (2,3) $
- $ (2,1) $ , $ (2,2) $</div>
