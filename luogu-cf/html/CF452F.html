<h1>Permutation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
给你一个1到n的排列，你需要判断该排列内部是否存在一个3个元素的子序列(可以不连续)，使得这个子序列是等差序列。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
第一行一个整数$n(n\leq 3\times10^5)$，表示给出的序列的长度。
第二行有$n$个整数，表示这个排列。
### 输出格式：
如果存在，输出`YES`，反之输出`NO`。答案的大小写无所谓。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a permutation of numbers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Determine whether there's a pair of integers $ a,b $ $ (1<=a,b<=n; a≠b) $ such that the element ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF452F/79a61ff17360227fbc1ddd07b61b3ec2cf482ac4.png) (note, that it is usual division, not integer one) is between $ a $ and $ b $ in this permutation.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line consists of a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=300000 $ ) — the size of permutation.
Second line contains $ n $ integers — the permutation itself.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES", if such a pair exists, "NO" otherwise (in both cases without quotes, the answer is case insensitive).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4
1 3 4 2
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>NO
</code></pre>
<h3>输入样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>5
1 5 2 4 3
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #2</h3>
<pre><code>YES
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In the second example $ 2 $ is between $ 1 $ and $ 3 $ . Additionally $ 4 $ is between $ 3 $ and $ 5 $ .</div>
