# Family Photos

## 题意翻译

有两个人 *Alice* 和 *Bonnie* 他们分别取照片，共有 $n$ 组照片，*Alice* 先取，每组照片有两张且必须先取第一张，再取第二张，每组照片对于 *Alice* 和 *Bonnie* 分别有价值 $A_1,B_1,A_2,B_2$ ，分别表示 *Alice* 和 *Bonnie* 取每组照片的第一第二张能的得到的价值，假设 *Alice* 和 *Bonnie* 都足够聪明，他们都希望自己的价值 $-$ 别人的价值尽可能大，求 *Alice* 和 *Bonnie* 的价值差。

## 题目描述

Alice and Bonnie are sisters, but they don't like each other very much. So when some old family photos were found in the attic, they started to argue about who should receive which photos. In the end, they decided that they would take turns picking photos. Alice goes first.

There are $ n $ stacks of photos. Each stack contains exactly two photos. In each turn, a player may take only a photo from the top of one of the stacks.

Each photo is described by two non-negative integers $ a $ and $ b $ , indicating that it is worth $ a $ units of happiness to Alice and $ b $ units of happiness to Bonnie. Values of $ a $ and $ b $ might differ for different photos.

It's allowed to pass instead of taking a photo. The game ends when all photos are taken or both players pass consecutively.

The players don't act to maximize their own happiness. Instead, each player acts to maximize the amount by which her happiness exceeds her sister's. Assuming both players play optimal, find the difference between Alice's and Bonnie's happiness. That is, if there's a perfectly-played game such that Alice has $ x $ happiness and Bonnie has $ y $ happiness at the end, you should print $ x-y $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of two-photo stacks. Then follow $ n $ lines, each describing one of the stacks. A stack is described by four space-separated non-negative integers $ a_{1} $ , $ b_{1} $ , $ a_{2} $ and $ b_{2} $ , each not exceeding $ 10^{9} $ . $ a_{1} $ and $ b_{1} $ describe the top photo in the stack, while $ a_{2} $ and $ b_{2} $ describe the bottom photo in the stack.

### 输出格式

Output a single integer: the difference between Alice's and Bonnie's happiness if both play optimally.
