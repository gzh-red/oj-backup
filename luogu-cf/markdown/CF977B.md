# Two-gram

## 题意翻译

给你一个字符串，找出现次数最多的长度为2的子串。

## 题目描述

Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.

You are given a string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string $ s $ = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in $ s $ three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.

Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains integer number $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 100 $ ) — the length of string $ s $ . The second line of the input contains the string $ s $ consisting of $ n $ capital Latin letters.

### 输出格式

Print the only line containing exactly two capital Latin letters — any two-gram contained in the given string $ s $ as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times.
