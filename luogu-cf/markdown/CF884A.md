## 题目描述

Recently Luba bought a very interesting book. She knows that it will take $ t $ seconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.

But she has some work to do in each of $ n $ next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during $ i $ -th day is $ a_{i} $ . If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.

Help Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.

It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed $ n $ .

Remember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.
