# Almost Arithmetical Progression

## 题目描述

Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:

- $ a_{1}=p $ , where $ p $ is some integer;

- $ a_{i}=a_{i-1}+(-1)^{i+1}·q $ $ (i&gt;1) $ , where $ q $ is some integer.

Right now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence $ b $ , consisting of $ n $ integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.

Sequence $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k} $ is a subsequence of sequence $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ , if there is such increasing sequence of indexes $ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...\ &lt;i_{k}<=n) $ , that $ b_{ij}=s_{j} $ . In other words, sequence $ s $ can be obtained from $ b $ by crossing out some elements.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=4000) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=10^{6}) $ .

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the length of the required longest subsequence.

## 说明

In the first test the sequence actually is the suitable subsequence.

In the second test the following subsequence fits: $ 10,20,10 $ .
