# Ant colony

## 题意翻译

给出一个长度为 $n$ 的序列，$q$ 组询问

每次给定区间 $[l,r]$，将 $[l,r]$ 中的每个数两两比较

如果 $a,b \in [l,r]$， $a|b$ 则 $a$ 得一分， $b|a$ 则 $b$ 得一分

问有多少个没有得到满分

## 题目描述

Mole is hungry again. He found one ant colony, consisting of $ n $ ants, ordered in a row. Each ant $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) has a strength $ s_{i} $ .

In order to make his dinner more interesting, Mole organizes a version of «Hunger Games» for the ants. He chooses two numbers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ ) and each pair of ants with indices between $ l $ and $ r $ (inclusively) will fight. When two ants $ i $ and $ j $ fight, ant $ i $ gets one battle point only if $ s_{i} $ divides $ s_{j} $ (also, ant $ j $ gets one battle point only if $ s_{j} $ divides $ s_{i} $ ).

After all fights have been finished, Mole makes the ranking. An ant $ i $ , with $ v_{i} $ battle points obtained, is going to be freed only if $ v_{i}=r-l $ , or in other words only if it took a point in every fight it participated. After that, Mole eats the rest of the ants. Note that there can be many ants freed or even none.

In order to choose the best sequence, Mole gives you $ t $ segments $ \[l_{i},r_{i}\] $ and asks for each of them how many ants is he going to eat if those ants fight.
