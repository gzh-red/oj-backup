# Add Points

## 题意翻译

有一条数轴上有n个点。输入n和每个点的坐标，输出使每两个相邻点距离相同，最少要加入多少个点。

样例1解释：加入一个坐标为0的点，则$\text{0-(-5)=5-0=10-5=5}$，所以至少加入一个点。

## 题目描述

There are $ n $ points on a straight line, and the $ i $ -th point among them is located at $ x_{i} $ . All these coordinates are distinct.

Determine the number $ m $ — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of points.

The second line contains a sequence of integers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ) — the coordinates of the points. All these coordinates are distinct. The points can be given in an arbitrary order.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer $ m $ — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal.

```
## 说明

In the first example you can add one point with coordinate $ 0 $ .

In the second example the distances between all neighboring points are already equal, so you shouldn't add anything.
