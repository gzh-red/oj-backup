## 题目描述

A TV show called "Guess a number!" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.

The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer $ y $ and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:

- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly larger than number $ x $ ?

- Is it true that $ y $ is strictly smaller than number $ x $ ?

- Is it true that $ y $ is larger than or equal to number $ x $ ?

- Is it true that $ y $ is smaller than or equal to number $ x $ ?

On each question the host answers truthfully, "yes" or "no".

Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of $ y $ that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print "Impossible".

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000 $ ) — the number of questions (and answers). Next $ n $ lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: "sign x answer", where the sign is:

- ">" (for the first type queries),

- "<" (for the second type queries),

- ">=" (for the third type queries),

- "<=" (for the fourth type queries).

All values of $ x $ are integer and meet the inequation $ -10^{9}<=x<=10^{9} $ . The answer is an English letter "Y" (for "yes") or "N" (for "no").

Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space.

### 输出格式

Print any of such integers $ y $ , that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number $ y $ must meet the inequation $ -2·10^{9}<=y<=2·10^{9} $ . If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word "Impossible" (without the quotes).
