## 题目描述

On the math lesson a teacher asked each pupil to come up with his own lucky numbers. As a fan of number theory Peter chose prime numbers. Bob was more original. He said that number $ t $ is his lucky number, if it can be represented as:

$ t=a^{2}+b^{2}, $ where $ a,b $ are arbitrary positive integers.Now, the boys decided to find out how many days of the interval $ [l,r] $ ( $ l<=r $ ) are suitable for pair programming. They decided that the day $ i $ ( $ l<=i<=r $ ) is suitable for pair programming if and only if the number $ i $ is lucky for Peter and lucky for Bob at the same time. Help the boys to find the number of such days.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains integer numbers $ l,r $ ( $ 1<=l,r<=3·10^{8} $ ).

### 输出格式

In the only line print the number of days on the segment $ [l,r] $ , which are lucky for Peter and Bob at the same time.
