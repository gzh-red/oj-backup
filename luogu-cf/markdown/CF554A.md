# Kyoya and Photobooks

## 题意翻译

zpy有一个字符串，仅有小写字母构成。有一天，他想给这个字符串加一个小写字母，可以加在开头或者结尾或者中间任何位置，加完后，变成新的字符串了。他想知道，新加一个字母，可以变成的新字符串有多少种？

比如原先字符串”a”，新加一个小写字母后可以为：”aa”, ”ab”, ”ba”, ”ac”, ”ca”直到”az”, ”za”，一共51种，注意”aa”只算一次。

## 题目描述

Kyoya Ootori is selling photobooks of the Ouran High School Host Club. He has 26 photos, labeled "a" to "z", and he has compiled them into a photo booklet with some photos in some order (possibly with some photos being duplicated). A photo booklet can be described as a string of lowercase letters, consisting of the photos in the booklet in order. He now wants to sell some "special edition" photobooks, each with one extra photo inserted anywhere in the book. He wants to make as many distinct photobooks as possible, so he can make more money. He asks Haruhi, how many distinct photobooks can he make by inserting one extra photo into the photobook he already has?

Please help Haruhi solve this problem.
