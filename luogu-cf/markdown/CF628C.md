# Bear and String Distance

## 题目描述

Limak is a little polar bear. He likes nice strings — strings of length $ n $ , consisting of lowercase English letters only.

The distance between two letters is defined as the difference between their positions in the alphabet. For example, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/8da66884325cabbb3822b7a59fabab06b8c9aecb.png), and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/020a67d9684ce0de62952b277c91f6ba625d786b.png).

Also, the distance between two nice strings is defined as the sum of distances of corresponding letters. For example, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/88d3180afa5197edf3d9181b6092568129b849de.png), and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/fb925baf4ad15f3149211e4c7e1c24edfeeed3f5.png).

Limak gives you a nice string $ s $ and an integer $ k $ . He challenges you to find any nice string $ s' $ that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/6ced56c16665504eebcfadbb27cc9012566c4756.png). Find any $ s' $ satisfying the given conditions, or print "-1" if it's impossible to do so.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ , $ 0<=k<=10^{6} $ ).

The second line contains a string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of lowercase English letters.

### 输出格式

If there is no string satisfying the given conditions then print "-1" (without the quotes).

Otherwise, print any nice string $ s' $ that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF628C/6ced56c16665504eebcfadbb27cc9012566c4756.png).
