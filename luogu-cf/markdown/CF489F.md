# Special Matrices

## 题目描述

An $ n×n $ square matrix is special, if:

- it is binary, that is, each cell contains either a 0, or a 1;

- the number of ones in each row and column equals 2.

You are given $ n $ and the first $ m $ rows of the matrix. Print the number of special $ n×n $ matrices, such that the first $ m $ rows coincide with the given ones.

As the required value can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the value by the given number $ mod $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ mod $ ( $ 2<=n<=500 $ , $ 0<=m<=n $ , $ 2<=mod<=10^{9} $ ). Then $ m $ lines follow, each of them contains $ n $ characters — the first rows of the required special matrices. Each of these lines contains exactly two characters '1', the rest characters are '0'. Each column of the given $ m×n $ table contains at most two numbers one.

### 输出格式

Print the remainder after dividing the required value by number $ mod $ .
