## 题目描述

Vanya and his friends are walking along the fence of height $ h $ and they do not want the guard to notice them. In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed $ h $ . If the height of some person is greater than $ h $ he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the $ i $ -th person is equal to $ a_{i} $ .

Consider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to $ 1 $ , while the width of the bent person is equal to $ 2 $ . Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ h $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=h<=1000 $ ) — the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=2h $ ), the $ i $ -th of them is equal to the height of the $ i $ -th person.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road.

## 说明

In the first sample, only person number $ 3 $ must bend down, so the required width is equal to $ 1+1+2=4 $ .

In the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width $ 1+1+1+1+1+1=6 $ is enough.

In the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to $ 2+2+2+2+2+1=11 $ .
