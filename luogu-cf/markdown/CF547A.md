# Mike and Frog

## 题目描述

Mike has a frog and a flower. His frog is named Xaniar and his flower is named Abol. Initially(at time $ 0 $ ), height of Xaniar is $ h_{1} $ and height of Abol is $ h_{2} $ . Each second, Mike waters Abol and Xaniar.

Mike is a competitive programmer fan. He wants to know the minimum time it takes until height of Xania is $ a_{1} $ and height of Abol is $ a_{2} $ .

Mike has asked you for your help. Calculate the minimum time or say it will never happen.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains integer $ m $ ( $ 2<=m<=10^{6} $ ).

The second line of input contains integers $ h_{1} $ and $ a_{1} $ ( $ 0<=h_{1},a_{1}&lt;m $ ).

The third line of input contains integers $ x_{1} $ and $ y_{1} $ ( $ 0<=x_{1},y_{1}&lt;m $ ).

The fourth line of input contains integers $ h_{2} $ and $ a_{2} $ ( $ 0<=h_{2},a_{2}&lt;m $ ).

The fifth line of input contains integers $ x_{2} $ and $ y_{2} $ ( $ 0<=x_{2},y_{2}&lt;m $ ).

It is guaranteed that $ h_{1}≠a_{1} $ and $ h_{2}≠a_{2} $ .

### 输出格式

Print the minimum number of seconds until Xaniar reaches height $ a_{1} $ and Abol reaches height $ a_{2} $ or print -1 otherwise.
