# Number Busters

## 题目描述

Arthur and Alexander are number busters. Today they've got a competition.

Arthur took a group of four integers $ a,b,w,x $ $ (0=x $ , perform the assignment $ b=b-x $ , if $ b&lt;x $ , then perform two consecutive assignments $ a=a-1; b=w-(x-b) $ .

You've got numbers $ a,b,w,x,c $ . Determine when Alexander gets ahead of Arthur if both guys start performing the operations at the same time. Assume that Alexander got ahead of Arthur if $ c<=a $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integers $ a,b,w,x,c $ $ (1<=a<=2·10^{9},1<=w<=1000,0<=b&lt;w,0&lt;x&lt;w,1<=c<=2·10^{9}) $ .

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the minimum time in seconds Alexander needs to get ahead of Arthur. You can prove that the described situation always occurs within the problem's limits.
