# Sandy and Nuts

## 题意翻译

你曾经有一棵（以1号点为根的）树，但你却忘记了它的形态，只记得其中的m条边，以及q对关系：ai号点和bi号点的LCA为ci号点。现在你想知道有多少种满足这些条件的树。

## 题目描述

Rooted tree is a connected graph without any simple cycles with one vertex selected as a root. In this problem the vertex number $ 1 $ will always serve as a root.

Lowest common ancestor of two vertices $ u $ and $ v $ is the farthest from the root vertex that lies on both the path from $ u $ to the root and on path from $ v $ to the root. We will denote it as $ LCA(u,v) $ .

Sandy had a rooted tree consisting of $ n $ vertices that she used to store her nuts. Unfortunately, the underwater storm broke her tree and she doesn't remember all it's edges. She only managed to restore $ m $ edges of the initial tree and $ q $ triples $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ and $ c_{i} $ , for which she supposes $ LCA(a_{i},b_{i})=c_{i} $ .

Help Sandy count the number of trees of size $ n $ with vertex $ 1 $ as a root, that match all the information she remembered. If she made a mess and there are no such trees then print $ 0 $ . Two rooted trees are considered to be distinct if there exists an edge that occur in one of them and doesn't occur in the other one.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains three integers $ n $ , $ m $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=13,0<=m<n,0<=q<=100 $ ) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and $ LCA $ triples remembered by Sandy respectively. Each of the next $ m $ lines contains two integers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n,u_{i}≠v_{i} $ ) — the numbers of vertices connected by the $ i $ -th edge. It's guaranteed that this set of edges is a subset of edges of some tree.

The last $ q $ lines contain the triplets of numbers $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i} $ , $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i},c_{i}<=n) $ . Each of these triples define $ LCA(a_{i},b_{i})=c_{i} $ . It's not guaranteed that there exists a tree that satisfy all the given $ LCA $ conditions.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the number of trees of size $ n $ that satisfy all the conditions.

## 说明

In the second sample correct answer looks like this:
