# Sheldon and Ice Pieces

## 题目描述

Do you remember how Kai constructed the word "eternity" using pieces of ice as components?

Little Sheldon plays with pieces of ice, each piece has exactly one digit between 0 and 9. He wants to construct his favourite number $ t $ . He realized that digits 6 and 9 are very similar, so he can rotate piece of ice with 6 to use as 9 (and vice versa). Similary, 2 and 5 work the same. There is no other pair of digits with similar effect. He called this effect "Digital Mimicry".

Sheldon favourite number is $ t $ . He wants to have as many instances of $ t $ as possible. How many instances he can construct using the given sequence of ice pieces. He can use any piece at most once.
