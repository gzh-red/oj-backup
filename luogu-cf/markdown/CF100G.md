The famous singer, Aryo, is going to publish a new album of his great work!

If he finds a suitable name which has not been used before, he'll use it. Otherwise he will use the name which was used as long ago as possible. If two such names are found (that haven't been used or were used at the same year), he uses the name that is alphabetically latest.
