# Bear and Up-Down

## 题目描述

The life goes up and down, just like nice sequences. Sequence $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ is called nice if the following two conditions are satisfied:

- $ t_{i}&lt;t_{i+1} $ for each odd $ i&lt;n $ ;

- $ t_{i}&gt;t_{i+1} $ for each even $ i&lt;n $ .

For example, sequences $ (2,8) $ , $ (1,5,1) $ and $ (2,5,1,100,99,120) $ are nice, while $ (1,1) $ , $ (1,2,3) $ and $ (2,5,3,2) $ are not.

Bear Limak has a sequence of positive integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ . This sequence is not nice now and Limak wants to fix it by a single swap. He is going to choose two indices $ i&lt;j $ and swap elements $ t_{i} $ and $ t_{j} $ in order to get a nice sequence. Count the number of ways to do so. Two ways are considered different if indices of elements chosen for a swap are different.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=150000 $ ) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n} $ ( $ 1<=t_{i}<=150000 $ ) — the initial sequence. It's guaranteed that the given sequence is not nice.

### 输出格式

Print the number of ways to swap two elements exactly once in order to get a nice sequence.

## 说明

In the first sample, there are two ways to get a nice sequence with one swap:

1. Swap $ t_{2}=8 $ with $ t_{4}=7 $ .

2. Swap $ t_{1}=2 $ with $ t_{5}=7 $ .

In the second sample, there is only one way — Limak should swap $ t_{1}=200 $ with $ t_{4}=50 $ .
