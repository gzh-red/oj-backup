# Suffix Subgroup

## 题目描述

You are given a group of $ n $ strings: $ s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n} $ .

You should find a subgroup $ s_{i1},s_{i2},...,s_{ik} $ $ (1<=i_{1}&lt;i_{2}&lt;...&lt;i_{k}<=n) $ of the group. The following two conditions must hold:

- there exists a string $ t $ such, that each string from found subgroup is its suffix;

- the number of strings in the found subgroup is as large as possible.

Your task is to print the number of strings in the found subgroup.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of strings in the group. Each of the next $ n $ lines contains a string. The $ i $ -th line contains non-empty string $ s_{i} $ .

Each string consists only from lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all strings $ s_{i} $ doesn't exceed $ 10^{5} $ .

### 输出格式

Output a single integer — the number of strings in the found subgroup.
