# Magnets

## 题意翻译

# 题目描述：

有n个条形磁铁排列再桌子上，它们跟普通的磁铁一样，都是同极相斥，异极相吸。现在给定了它们的两极，连续两个磁铁如果方向一致那就会吸引，合并成一条更长的磁铁。现在请问桌上会有几个分开的磁铁？

# 输入输出格式：

## 输入：

输入共n+1行。第一行代表磁铁的总数n（1≤n≤100000），接下来的n行，每行给定了磁铁的两极，1代表正极，0代表负极。例如：“01”代表正极在左，负极在右，“10”则反之（注意：磁铁的两极不能调换，即“01”不能调换成“10”）。

## 输出：

输出仅一行，代表能够连续相吸的磁铁总数。

## 题目描述

Mad scientist Mike entertains himself by arranging rows of dominoes. He doesn't need dominoes, though: he uses rectangular magnets instead. Each magnet has two poles, positive (a "plus") and negative (a "minus"). If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.

Mike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100000 $ ) — the number of magnets. Then $ n $ lines follow. The $ i $ -th line ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) contains either characters "01", if Mike put the $ i $ -th magnet in the "plus-minus" position, or characters "10", if Mike put the magnet in the "minus-plus" position.

### 输出格式

On the single line of the output print the number of groups of magnets.

## 说明

The first testcase corresponds to the figure. The testcase has three groups consisting of three, one and two magnets.

The second testcase has two groups, each consisting of two magnets.
