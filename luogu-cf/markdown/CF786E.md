# ALT

## 题意翻译

给一颗n个节点的树，每个边上有一个守卫。有m个居民，每个居民有一个散步路径（两个节点的树上最短路）。一个居民高兴当且仅当他获得了一个宠物或者他散步的路径上所有的守卫都有宠物。求最少需要几个宠物能让所有居民高兴。输出方案。

n,m <= 20000

输入格式：

第一行两个整数，n和m

接下来n-1行，每行两个整数，代表一条边

接下来m行，每行两个整数，代表一个居民的路径端点。

输出格式：

第一行一个数ans，表示最少的宠物数

第二行一个数p，代表给居民发的宠物数，接下来p个整数，表示获得宠物的居民

第三行一个数w，表示给守卫发的宠物数，接下来w个整数，表示获得宠物的守卫（编号为输入顺序）

## 题目描述

ALT is a planet in a galaxy called "Encore". Humans rule this planet but for some reason there's no dog in their planet, so the people there are sad and depressed. Rick and Morty are universal philanthropists and they want to make people in ALT happy.

ALT has $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ and $ n-1 $ bidirectional roads numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n-1 $ . One can go from any city to any other city using these roads.

There are two types of people in ALT:

1. Guardians. A guardian lives in a house alongside a road and guards the road.

2. Citizens. A citizen lives in a house inside a city and works in an office in another city.

Every person on ALT is either a guardian or a citizen and there's exactly one guardian alongside each road.

- There are $ m $ citizens living in ALT.

- Citizen number $ i $ lives in city number $ x_{i} $ and works in city number $ y_{i} $ .

- Every day each citizen will go through all roads along the shortest path from his home to his work.

- A citizen will be happy if and only if either he himself has a puppy himself or all of guardians along his path to his work has a puppy (he sees the guardian's puppy in each road and will be happy).

- A guardian is always happy.

You need to tell Rick and Morty the minimum number of puppies they need in order to make all people in ALT happy, and also provide an optimal way to distribute these puppies.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=2×10^{4} $ , $ 1<=m<=10^{4} $ ) — number of cities and number of citizens respectively.

The next $ n-1 $ lines contain the roads, $ i $ -th line contains endpoint of $ i $ -th edge, $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1<=v,u<=n $ , $ v≠u $ ).

The next $ m $ lines contain the information about citizens. $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ x_{i} $ and $ y_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i},y_{i}<=n $ , $ x_{i}≠y_{i} $ ).

### 输出格式

In the first line of input print a single integer $ k $ , the total number of puppies they need ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ).

In the second line print an integer $ q $ , the number of puppies to give to citizens, followed by $ q $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{q} $ , index of citizens to give puppy to ( $ 0<=q<=min(m,k) $ , $ 1<=a_{i}<=m $ ).

In the third line print an integer $ e $ , the number of puppies to give to guardians, followed by $ e $ distinct integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{e} $ , index of road of guardians to give puppy to ( $ 0<=e<=min(n-1,k) $ , $ 1<=b_{i}<=n-1 $ ).

Sum of $ q $ and $ e $ should be equal to $ k $ .
