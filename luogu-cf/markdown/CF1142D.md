## 题目描述

Traveling around the world you noticed that many shop owners raise prices to inadequate values if the see you are a foreigner.

You define inadequate numbers as follows:

- all integers from $ 1 $ to $ 9 $ are inadequate;

- for an integer $ x \ge 10 $ to be inadequate, it is required that the integer $ \lfloor x / 10 \rfloor $ is inadequate, but that's not the only condition. Let's sort all the inadequate integers. Let $ \lfloor x / 10 \rfloor $ have number $ k $ in this order. Then, the integer $ x $ is inadequate only if the last digit of $ x $ is strictly less than the reminder of division of $ k $ by $ 11 $ .

Here $ \lfloor x / 10 \rfloor $ denotes $ x/10 $ rounded down.

Thus, if $ x $ is the $ m $ -th in increasing order inadequate number, and $ m $ gives the remainder $ c $ when divided by $ 11 $ , then integers $ 10 \cdot x + 0, 10 \cdot x + 1 \ldots, 10 \cdot x + (c - 1) $ are inadequate, while integers $ 10 \cdot x + c, 10 \cdot x + (c + 1), \ldots, 10 \cdot x + 9 $ are not inadequate.

The first several inadequate integers are $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32 \ldots $ . After that, since $ 4 $ is the fourth inadequate integer, $ 40, 41, 42, 43 $ are inadequate, while $ 44, 45, 46, \ldots, 49 $ are not inadequate; since $ 10 $ is the $ 10 $ -th inadequate number, integers $ 100, 101, 102, \ldots, 109 $ are all inadequate. And since $ 20 $ is the $ 11 $ -th inadequate number, none of $ 200, 201, 202, \ldots, 209 $ is inadequate.

You wrote down all the prices you have seen in a trip. Unfortunately, all integers got concatenated in one large digit string $ s $ and you lost the bounds between the neighboring integers. You are now interested in the number of substrings of the resulting string that form an inadequate number. If a substring appears more than once at different positions, all its appearances are counted separately.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1 \le |s| \le 10^5 $ ), consisting only of digits. It is guaranteed that the first digit of $ s $ is not zero.

### 输出格式

In the only line print the number of substrings of $ s $ that form an inadequate number.

## 说明

In the first example the inadequate numbers in the string are $ 1, 2, 4, 21, 40, 402 $ .

In the second example the inadequate numbers in the string are $ 1 $ and $ 10 $ , and $ 1 $ appears twice (on the first and on the second positions).
