## 题目描述

Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is $ n $ . He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:

- After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length $ a $ , $ b $ or $ c $ .

- After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum.

Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ $ (1<=n,a,b,c<=4000) $ — the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ can coincide.
