# Say Hello

## 题意翻译

## **题目描述**

两个朋友正在芭比星系旅行。他们说“你好啊！”如果距离小于或等于d1且

·这是他们第一次交谈，或者

·在他们上次谈话后的某个时间点，他们的距离大于d2。

我们需要计算朋友们说“你好”的次数。彼此之间。对于n个时刻，您将为每个朋友提供一组点，代表他们在那一时刻的位置。一个人可以在两个时刻之间保持相同的位置，但是如果一个人移动了，我们假设这个移动是以恒定的速度在恒定的方向上移动。

## 输入输出格式

输出包含一个整数，表示朋友彼此之间会说“你好啊！”的次数。

## 题目描述

Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than $ d_1 $ and

- it's the first time they speak to each other or

- at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than $ d_2 $ .

We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For $ N $ moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains one integer number $ N $ ( $ 2 \leq N \leq 100\,000 $ ) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.

The second line contains two integer numbers $ d_1 $ and $ d_2 \ (0 < d_1 < d_2 < 1000) $ .

The next $ N $ lines contains four integer numbers $ A_x,A_y,B_x,B_y $ ( $ 0 \leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y \leq 1000 $ ) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.

### 输出格式

Output contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other.
