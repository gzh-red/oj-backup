# New Language

## 题意翻译

现在有一门新语言，他的单词组成规则如下：

· 单词是由一些元音字母和辅音字母组成；

· 所有的单词长度是n；

· 有m条形如 (pos1, t1, pos2, t2) 。每一规则表示，如果位置 pos1 上面的字母是类型 t1 的，那么位置 pos2 上面的字母类型一定要是 t2 的。

现在给定一个长度为n的字母串s，这个不一定是这个语言的合法单词。请找出该新语言中字典序不比s小的，且字典序要最小的合法单词。

样例解释：这个样例中，aa不是合法单词，ab是。

Input

单组测试数据。

第一行有包含'V' (Vowel，元音) 和 'C' (Consonant，辅音)的字符串，表示哪个字母是元音，哪个字母是辅音。这个字母串的长度L（1<=L<=26）表示当前新语言里面字母的个数。当前新语言用的是前L个小写字母。如果第i个字符是V，表示第i个字母是元音，否则就是辅音。

第二行包含两个整数n, m (1≤n≤200, 0≤m≤4n(n-1))，表示单词的长度和规则的数目。

接下来m行给出规则，形式如下pos1,t1,pos2,t2 (1≤pos1,pos2≤n, pos1≠pos2, t1,t2∈{'V', 'C' }).

最后一行有一个长度为n字符串s，只包含前L个小写字母。

输入中保证没有两条规则是一样的。

Output

输出新语言中字典序不小于s的，且字典序最小的合法单词。如果不存在输出-1。

## 题目描述

Living in Byteland was good enough to begin with, but the good king decided to please his subjects and to introduce a national language. He gathered the best of wise men, and sent an expedition to faraway countries, so that they would find out all about how a language should be designed.

After some time, the wise men returned from the trip even wiser. They locked up for six months in the dining room, after which they said to the king: "there are a lot of different languages, but almost all of them have letters that are divided into vowels and consonants; in a word, vowels and consonants must be combined correctly."

There are very many rules, all of them have exceptions, but our language will be deprived of such defects! We propose to introduce a set of formal rules of combining vowels and consonants, and include in the language all the words that satisfy them.

The rules of composing words are:

- The letters are divided into vowels and consonants in some certain way;

- All words have a length of exactly $ n $ ;

- There are $ m $ rules of the form ( $ pos_{1},t_{1},pos_{2},t_{2} $ ). Each rule is: if the position $ pos_{1} $ has a letter of type $ t_{1} $ , then the position $ pos_{2} $ has a letter of type $ t_{2} $ .

You are given some string $ s $ of length $ n $ , it is not necessarily a correct word of the new language. Among all the words of the language that lexicographically not smaller than the string $ s $ , find the minimal one in lexicographic order.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single line consisting of letters 'V' (Vowel) and 'C' (Consonant), determining which letters are vowels and which letters are consonants. The length of this string $ l $ is the size of the alphabet of the new language ( $ 1<=l<=26 $ ). The first $ l $ letters of the English alphabet are used as the letters of the alphabet of the new language. If the $ i $ -th character of the string equals to 'V', then the corresponding letter is a vowel, otherwise it is a consonant.

The second line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=200 $ , $ 0<=m<=4n(n-1) $ ) — the number of letters in a single word and the number of rules, correspondingly.

Next $ m $ lines describe $ m $ rules of the language in the following format: $ pos_{1},t_{1},pos_{2},t_{2} $ ( $ 1<=pos_{1},pos_{2}<=n $ , $ pos_{1}≠pos_{2} $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF568C/6d2034378f0e35101a693c8a446695be226ccbb1.png) 'V', 'C' $ } $ ).

The last line contains string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of the first $ l $ small letters of the English alphabet.

It is guaranteed that no two rules are the same.

### 输出格式

Print a smallest word of a language that is lexicographically not smaller than $ s $ . If such words does not exist (for example, if the language has no words at all), print "-1" (without the quotes).

## 说明

In the first test word "aa" is not a word of the language, but word "ab" is.

In the second test out of all four possibilities only word "bb" is not a word of a language, but all other words are lexicographically less, so there is no answer.

In the third test, due to the last rule, "abac" doesn't belong to the language ("a" is a vowel, "c" is a consonant). The only word with prefix "ab" that meets the given rules is "abaa". But it is less than "abac", so the answer will be "acaa"
