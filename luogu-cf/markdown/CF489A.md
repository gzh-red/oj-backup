# SwapSort

## 题意翻译

给定一个长度为$n$的序列，用不超过$n$次交换任意两个元素排序序列。输出交换方案。

$1\le n\le3000$ $-10^9\le a_i\le10^9$

数组下标从$0$开始

## 题目描述

In this problem your goal is to sort an array consisting of $ n $ integers in at most $ n $ swaps. For the given array find the sequence of swaps that makes the array sorted in the non-descending order. Swaps are performed consecutively, one after another.

Note that in this problem you do not have to minimize the number of swaps — your task is to find any sequence that is no longer than $ n $ .
