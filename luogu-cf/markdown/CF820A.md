# Mister B and Book Reading

## 题意翻译

**题目描述：**

B先生收到了一本关于外星人的书，他立刻开始读了起来，这本书共c页

在第一天，B先生读了v0本书

因为他记性不好，每天都要读上一天读的最后l页

所以接下来的第i天他要读（-v0 + i*a）页书

但是B先生终觉是一个人，所以他每天阅读的页书不能超过v1页

请你编写一个程序，帮助B先生算出他需要多少天再能把这本书读完

**输入输出格式：**

**输入格式：**

一行，包括5个数c,v0,v1,a,l

(1 <= c <= 1000, 1 <= c <= 1000, 1 <= c <= 1000, v0 <= v1 <= 1000 ，0 <= a 

**输出格式：**

一个整数，表示B先生读完这本书需要的天数

**说明：**

样例1：因为这本书只有5页，所以B先生一天就读完了

样例2：B先生第一天读了1-4页，第二天4-11，第三天11-12

样例3：因为B先生每天只读一页，所以需要15天读完 

## 题目描述

Mister B once received a gift: it was a book about aliens, which he started read immediately. This book had $ c $ pages.

At first day Mister B read $ v_{0} $ pages, but after that he started to speed up. Every day, starting from the second, he read $ a $ pages more than on the previous day (at first day he read $ v_{0} $ pages, at second — $ v_{0}+a $ pages, at third — $ v_{0}+2a $ pages, and so on). But Mister B is just a human, so he physically wasn't able to read more than $ v_{1} $ pages per day.

Also, to refresh his memory, every day, starting from the second, Mister B had to reread last $ l $ pages he read on the previous day. Mister B finished the book when he read the last page for the first time.

Help Mister B to calculate how many days he needed to finish the book.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First and only line contains five space-separated integers: $ c $ , $ v_{0} $ , $ v_{1} $ , $ a $ and $ l $ ( $ 1<=c<=1000 $ , $ 0<=l&lt;v_{0}<=v_{1}<=1000 $ , $ 0<=a<=1000 $ ) — the length of the book in pages, the initial reading speed, the maximum reading speed, the acceleration in reading speed and the number of pages for rereading.

### 输出格式

Print one integer — the number of days Mister B needed to finish the book.

## 说明

In the first sample test the book contains $ 5 $ pages, so Mister B read it right at the first day.

In the second sample test at first day Mister B read pages number $ 1-4 $ , at second day — $ 4-11 $ , at third day — $ 11-12 $ and finished the book.

In third sample test every day Mister B read $ 1 $ page of the book, so he finished in 15 days.
