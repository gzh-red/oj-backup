# Economy Game

## 题意翻译

给定一个正整数n(1<n<1e9),判断是否存在自然数a,b,c满足a×1234567+b×123456+c×1234=n.

## 题目描述

Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to $ 0 $ .

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to $ n $ and that he have bought only some houses (for $ 1234567 $ game-coins each), cars (for $ 123456 $ game-coins each) and computers (for $ 1234 $ game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial $ n $ game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ such that $ a×1234567+b×123456+c×1234=n $ ?

Please help Kolya answer this question.
