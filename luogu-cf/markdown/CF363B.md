# Fence

## 题意翻译

给定一个长度为$n$的序列$h$,现在,给定一个$k$,要求你在所有长度为$k$的区间中选取一个使得它的区间和尽可能小,输出这个区间的起始位置.如果有多个满足要求的区间,输出任意一个即可.

## 题目描述

There is a fence in front of Polycarpus's home. The fence consists of $ n $ planks of the same width which go one after another from left to right. The height of the $ i $ -th plank is $ h_{i} $ meters, distinct planks can have distinct heights.

In order to carry out his plan, he needs to take exactly $ k $ consecutive planks from the fence. Higher planks are harder to tear off the fence, so Polycarpus wants to find such $ k $ consecutive planks that the sum of their heights is minimal possible.

Write the program that finds the indexes of $ k $ consecutive planks with minimal total height. Pay attention, the fence is not around Polycarpus's home, it is in front of home (in other words, the fence isn't cyclic).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=1.5·10^{5},1<=k<=n $ ) — the number of planks in the fence and the width of the hole for the piano. The second line contains the sequence of integers $ h_{1},h_{2},...,h_{n} $ ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=100 $ ), where $ h_{i} $ is the height of the $ i $ -th plank of the fence.

### 输出格式

Print such integer $ j $ that the sum of the heights of planks $ j $ , $ j+1 $ , ..., $ j+k-1 $ is the minimum possible. If there are multiple such $ j $ 's, print any of them.

## 说明

In the sample, your task is to find three consecutive planks with the minimum sum of heights. In the given case three planks with indexes 3, 4 and 5 have the required attribute, their total height is 8.
