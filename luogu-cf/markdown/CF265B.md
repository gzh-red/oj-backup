# Roadside Trees (Simplified Edition)

## 题目描述

Squirrel Liss loves nuts. There are $ n $ trees (numbered $ 1 $ to $ n $ from west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the tree $ i $ is $ h_{i} $ . Liss wants to eat all nuts.

Now Liss is on the root of the tree with the number $ 1 $ . In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:

- Walk up or down one unit on a tree.

- Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.

- Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height $ h $ of the tree $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n-1 $ ), she jumps to height $ h $ of the tree $ i+1 $ . This action can't be performed if $ h&gt;h_{i+1} $ .

Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of trees.

Next $ n $ lines contains the height of trees: $ i $ -th line contains an integer $ h_{i} $ ( $ 1<=h_{i}<=10^{4} $ ) — the height of the tree with the number $ i $ .

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds.
