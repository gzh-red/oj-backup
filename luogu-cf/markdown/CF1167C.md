# News Distribution

## 题意翻译

有$n$个人和$m$组关系，每组关系包含若干人。

如果一组关系中的某个人得知了一条消息，他会将消息传递给他所在的每组关系中的每个人。

对于每个人，求出其可以把一条消息传递给最多多少人(包括自己)。

## 题目描述

In some social network, there are $ n $ users communicating with each other in $ m $ groups of friends. Let's analyze the process of distributing some news between users.

Initially, some user $ x $ receives the news from some source. Then he or she sends the news to his or her friends (two users are friends if there is at least one group such that both of them belong to this group). Friends continue sending the news to their friends, and so on. The process ends when there is no pair of friends such that one of them knows the news, and another one doesn't know.

For each user $ x $ you have to determine what is the number of users that will know the news if initially only user $ x $ starts distributing it.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n, m \le 5 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of users and the number of groups of friends, respectively.

Then $ m $ lines follow, each describing a group of friends. The $ i $ -th line begins with integer $ k_i $ ( $ 0 \le k_i \le n $ ) — the number of users in the $ i $ -th group. Then $ k_i $ distinct integers follow, denoting the users belonging to the $ i $ -th group.

It is guaranteed that $ \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{m} k_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5 $ .

### 输出格式

Print $ n $ integers. The $ i $ -th integer should be equal to the number of users that will know the news if user $ i $ starts distributing it.
