# Good String

## 题目描述

You have a string $ s $ of length $ n $ consisting of only characters > and , the character that comes right after it is deleted (if the character you chose was the last one, nothing happens). If you choose a character <, the character that comes right before it is deleted (if the character you chose was the first one, nothing happens).

For example, if we choose character > in string > > , the string will become to > > >. And if we choose character  <, the string will become to 

The string is good if there is a sequence of operations such that after performing it only one character will remain in the string. For example, the strings >, > > are good.

Before applying the operations, you may remove any number of characters from the given string (possibly none, possibly up to $ n - 1 $ , but not the whole string). You need to calculate the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $ s $ so that it becomes good.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 100 $ ) – the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two lines.

The first line of $ i $ -th test case contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 100 $ ) – the length of string $ s $ .

The second line of $ i $ -th test case contains string $ s $ , consisting of only characters > and <.

### 输出格式

For each test case print one line.

For $ i $ -th test case print the minimum number of characters to be deleted from string $ s $ so that it becomes good.

## 说明

In the first test case we can delete any character in string .

In the second test case we don't need to delete any characters. The string > <  < < $ \rightarrow $ < < $ \rightarrow $ <.
