# Gargari and Permutations

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

给你k个长度为n的排列，求这些排列的最长公共子序列的长度

## 输入格式

第一行包含n(1<=n<=1000)和k(2<=k

后面的k行分别表示k个排列。

## 输出格式

输出最长公共子序列的长度

## 说明

第一个测试样本的答案是子序列[1,2,3]。

## 题目描述

Gargari got bored to play with the bishops and now, after solving the problem about them, he is trying to do math homework. In a math book he have found $ k $ permutations. Each of them consists of numbers $ 1,2,...,n $ in some order. Now he should find the length of the longest common subsequence of these permutations. Can you help Gargari?

You can read about longest common subsequence there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest\_common\_subsequence\_problem

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n<=1000; 2<=k<=5) $ . Each of the next $ k $ lines contains integers $ 1,2,...,n $ in some order — description of the current permutation.

### 输出格式

Print the length of the longest common subsequence.
