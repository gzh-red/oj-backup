# Beautiful Divisors

## 题意翻译

给定n，求n最大的因数s，使s能表示成$(2^k-1)*(2^k-1)$的形式

## 题目描述

Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers. The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of $ k+1 $ consecutive ones, and then $ k $ consecutive zeroes.

Some examples of beautiful numbers:

- $ 1_{2} $ ( $ 1_{10} $ );

- $ 110_{2} $ ( $ 6_{10} $ );

- $ 1111000_{2} $ ( $ 120_{10} $ );

- $ 111110000_{2} $ ( $ 496_{10} $ ).

More formally, the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer $ k $ such that the number is equal to $ (2^{k}-1)*(2^{k-1}) $ .

Luba has got an integer number $ n $ , and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor. Help her to find it!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line of input contains one number $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number Luba has got.

### 输出格式

Output one number — the greatest beautiful divisor of Luba's number. It is obvious that the answer always exists.
