# Counting Kangaroos is Fun

## 题意翻译

数组a有n个数,若对于两个数a[i],a[j] (1<=i,j<=n且**a[i]≠0**),若a[i]<=a[j]/2,即可把a[i]删去,a[j]变为0。

输入n及数组a,求出最后可剩下的最少数量的数,输出其个数。

## 题目描述

There are $ n $ kangaroos with pockets. Each kangaroo has a size (integer number). A kangaroo can go into another kangaroo's pocket if and only if the size of kangaroo who hold the kangaroo is at least twice as large as the size of kangaroo who is held.

Each kangaroo can hold at most one kangaroo, and the kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot hold any kangaroos.

The kangaroo who is held by another kangaroo cannot be visible from outside. Please, find a plan of holding kangaroos with the minimal number of kangaroos who is visible.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer — $ n $ $ (1<=n<=5·10^{5}) $ . Each of the next $ n $ lines contains an integer $ s_{i} $ — the size of the $ i $ -th kangaroo $ (1<=s_{i}<=10^{5}) $ .

### 输出格式

Output a single integer — the optimal number of visible kangaroos.
