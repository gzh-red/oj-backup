## 题目描述

Let's call an undirected graph of $ n $ vertices $ p $ -interesting, if the following conditions fulfill:

- the graph contains exactly $ 2n+p $ edges;

- the graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges;

- for any integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ), any subgraph consisting of $ k $ vertices contains at most $ 2k+p $ edges.

A subgraph of a graph is some set of the graph vertices and some set of the graph edges. At that, the set of edges must meet the condition: both ends of each edge from the set must belong to the chosen set of vertices.

Your task is to find a $ p $ -interesting graph consisting of $ n $ vertices.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1<=t<=5 $ ) — the number of tests in the input. Next $ t $ lines each contains two space-separated integers: $ n $ , $ p $ ( $ 5<=n=0 $ ; ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF402C/5c1502c81534ca3ec91c7247a7dbb60fd411d7ba.png)) — the number of vertices in the graph and the interest value for the appropriate test.

It is guaranteed that the required graph exists.

### 输出格式

For each of the $ t $ tests print $ 2n+p $ lines containing the description of the edges of a $ p $ -interesting graph: the $ i $ -th line must contain two space-separated integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n; a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ) — two vertices, connected by an edge in the resulting graph. Consider the graph vertices numbered with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ .

Print the answers to the tests in the order the tests occur in the input. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
