# Police Station

## 题意翻译

题目描述：

berland道路安全网路是一个由n个城市组成，m条双向边相连的连通图。

政府官员觉得，当公民在***社会主义的和谐路***上行驶的时候，就不会翻车。一条路当且仅当两端有一个警察局时，就是***社会主义的和谐路！***

由于最近打黑反恶力度较强，警察局只能安放一个在n个城市间（没人了）。

现在问在哪个点建警察局能使从1到n的每条最短路（至少1条边不一样的最短路）上平均的***社会主义和谐路***的条数数

也就是：/cigma (每条最短路上的和谐路条数）/(不同的最短路条数)

最大。

政府肯定是有高精尖人才的，但是回家种田的你想要东山再起，还是要算算。

输入：

第一行n,m;

接下来m行u，v双向边。

输出:

一行一个double型ans，误差最多1e-6。

## 题目描述

The Berland road network consists of $ n $ cities and of $ m $ bidirectional roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to $ n $ , where the main capital city has number $ n $ , and the culture capital — number $ 1 $ . The road network is set up so that it is possible to reach any city from any other one by the roads. Moving on each road in any direction takes the same time.

All residents of Berland are very lazy people, and so when they want to get from city $ v $ to city $ u $ , they always choose one of the shortest paths (no matter which one).

The Berland government wants to make this country's road network safer. For that, it is going to put a police station in one city. The police station has a rather strange property: when a citizen of Berland is driving along the road with a police station at one end of it, the citizen drives more carefully, so all such roads are considered safe. The roads, both ends of which differ from the city with the police station, are dangerous.

Now the government wonders where to put the police station so that the average number of safe roads for all the shortest paths from the cultural capital to the main capital would take the maximum value.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first input line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF208C/9b7bf31ae68e1d60fef65c569392a7802b189697.png)) — the number of cities and the number of roads in Berland, correspondingly. Next $ m $ lines contain pairs of integers $ v_{i} $ , $ u_{i} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i},u_{i}<=n $ , $ v_{i}≠u_{i} $ ) — the numbers of cities that are connected by the $ i $ -th road. The numbers on a line are separated by a space.

It is guaranteed that each pair of cities is connected with no more than one road and that it is possible to get from any city to any other one along Berland roads.

### 输出格式

Print the maximum possible value of the average number of safe roads among all shortest paths from the culture capital to the main one. The answer will be considered valid if its absolute or relative inaccuracy does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .

## 说明

In the first sample you can put a police station in one of the capitals, then each path will have exactly one safe road. If we place the station not in the capital, then the average number of safe roads will also make ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF208C/4f500a162714534e43b066c5f5f2d811a8bad225.png).

In the second sample we can obtain the maximum sought value if we put the station in city $ 4 $ , then $ 6 $ paths will have $ 2 $ safe roads each, and one path will have $ 0 $ safe roads, so the answer will equal ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF208C/1f07abb000fedcaa79d701679480aab65a6674db.png).
