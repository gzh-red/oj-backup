# Timofey and cubes

## 题意翻译

假定你手里原本有一个含有n个数字的数列，你现在要对它进行这样一种操作：

令正整数i=1，只要i<=n-i+1，就把闭区间[i,n-i+1]所有的数字逆转，并且让i的值增加1，直到不满足条件为止。

其中“逆转”的例子如下：

对于数列8 6 5 9，逆转[2,4]后数列将变为8 9 5 6

输入数据为操作之后的数列，你需要找出原来的数列。输入数据不保证数列中没有重复元素。

## 题目描述

Young Timofey has a birthday today! He got kit of $ n $ cubes as a birthday present from his parents. Every cube has a number $ a_{i} $ , which is written on it. Timofey put all the cubes in a row and went to unpack other presents.

In this time, Timofey's elder brother, Dima reordered the cubes using the following rule. Suppose the cubes are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in their order. Dima performs several steps, on step $ i $ he reverses the segment of cubes from $ i $ -th to $ (n-i+1) $ -th. He does this while $ i<=n-i+1 $ .

After performing the operations Dima went away, being very proud of himself. When Timofey returned to his cubes, he understood that their order was changed. Help Timofey as fast as you can and save the holiday — restore the initial order of the cubes using information of their current location.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of cubes.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is the number written on the $ i $ -th cube after Dima has changed their order.

### 输出格式

Print $ n $ integers, separated by spaces — the numbers written on the cubes in their initial order.

It can be shown that the answer is unique.

## 说明

Consider the first sample.

1. At the begining row was \[ $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 4 $ \].

2. After first operation row was \[ $ 4 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 2 $ \].

3. After second operation row was \[ $ 4 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ \].

4. After third operation row was \[ $ 4 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ \].

5. At fourth operation we reverse just middle element, so nothing has changed. The final row is \[ $ 4 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ \]. So the answer for this case is row \[ $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 6 $ , $ 7 $ , $ 1 $ , $ 4 $ \].
