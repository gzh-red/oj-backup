## 题目描述

Two players play a simple game. Each player is provided with a box with balls. First player's box contains exactly $ n_{1} $ balls and second player's box contains exactly $ n_{2} $ balls. In one move first player can take from 1 to $ k_{1} $ balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to $ k_{2} $ balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. The one who can't make a move loses. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play optimally.
