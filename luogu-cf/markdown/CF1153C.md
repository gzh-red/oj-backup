# Serval and Parenthesis Sequence

## 题意翻译

NaCly_Fish 发明了括号序列，每个字符都是 '(' 或 ')'

他很强，所以他给你一个只含 "(", ")", "?" 的串，你需要在问号处填写左括号或是右括号，使得

- 每个严格前缀（严格前缀 指不是整个串的所有前缀）不是可匹配的括号序列

- 整个串是可匹配的括号序列

可匹配的括号序列 的意思是 可以匹配的括号序列。

你可以输出任意一种方案。

你甚至可能找不到方案，这时输出 ":(" 表示你对 NaCly_Fish 的膜拜。

## 题目描述

Serval soon said goodbye to Japari kindergarten, and began his life in Japari Primary School.

In his favorite math class, the teacher taught him the following interesting definitions.

A parenthesis sequence is a string, containing only characters "(" and ")".

A correct parenthesis sequence is a parenthesis sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, parenthesis sequences "()()", "(())" are correct (the resulting expressions are: "(1+1)+(1+1)", "((1+1)+1)"), while ")(" and ")" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition.

We define that $ |s| $ as the length of string $ s $ . A strict prefix $ s[1\dots l] $ $ (1\leq l< |s|) $ of a string $ s = s_1s_2\dots s_{|s|} $ is string $ s_1s_2\dots s_l $ . Note that the empty string and the whole string are not strict prefixes of any string by the definition.

Having learned these definitions, he comes up with a new problem. He writes down a string $ s $ containing only characters "(", ")" and "?". And what he is going to do, is to replace each of the "?" in $ s $ independently by one of "(" and ")" to make all strict prefixes of the new sequence not a correct parenthesis sequence, while the new sequence should be a correct parenthesis sequence.

After all, he is just a primary school student so this problem is too hard for him to solve. As his best friend, can you help him to replace the question marks? If there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ |s| $ ( $ 1\leq |s|\leq 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ), the length of the string.

The second line contains a string $ s $ , containing only "(", ")" and "?".

### 输出格式

A single line contains a string representing the answer.

If there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.

If there is no answer, print a single line containing ":(" (without the quotes).

## 输入输出样例

## 说明

It can be proved that there is no solution for the second sample, so print ":(".
