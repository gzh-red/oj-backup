# Kyoya and Train

## 题意翻译

# 题目描述

有$n$个车站从$1-n$编号，车站间有$m$条单向的列车，你要从$1$号车站到$n$号车站。

如果你在$t$时刻之后到达$n$号车站，你需要交$x$罚款。第$i$条单向列车路线从$a_i$开往$b_i$，票价为$c_i$。每条列车花费的时间从$1$到$t$对应不同的概率，第$i$条列车花费$k$时间的概率为$\frac{p_{i,k}}{100000}$。

数据保证对于对于同一辆车，$t$种时间的概率总和为$1$。多次乘坐同一条列车，花费时间的概率是独立的，票价也是独立的。求付出金钱(包括罚金)的最小期望。

精度误差不超过$10^{-6}$。

数据保证对于任何有序数对$(a,b)$。最多只有一条从$a$到$b$的列车。每次到达一个车站时，可以更改后续的计划。

# 数据范围

$2≤n≤50,1≤m≤100,1≤t≤20000,0≤x≤10^6$

$0≤c_i≤10^6,1≤p_{i,k}≤100000$

$\sum^{t}_{k=1}p_{i,k}=100000$

## 题目描述

Kyoya Ootori wants to take the train to get to school. There are $ n $ train stations and $ m $ one-way train lines going between various stations. Kyoya is currently at train station $ 1 $ , and the school is at station $ n $ . To take a train, he must pay for a ticket, and the train also takes a certain amount of time. However, the trains are not perfect and take random amounts of time to arrive at their destination. If Kyoya arrives at school strictly after $ t $ time units, he will have to pay a fine of $ x $ .

Each train line is described by a ticket price, and a probability distribution on the time the train takes. More formally, train line $ i $ has ticket cost $ c_{i} $ , and a probability distribution $ p_{i,k} $ which denotes the probability that this train will take $ k $ time units for all $ 1<=k<=t $ . Amounts of time that each of the trains used by Kyouya takes are mutually independent random values (moreover, if Kyoya travels along the same train more than once, it is possible for the train to take different amounts of time and those amounts are also independent one from another).

Kyoya wants to get to school by spending the least amount of money in expectation (for the ticket price plus possible fine for being late). Of course, Kyoya has an optimal plan for how to get to school, and every time he arrives at a train station, he may recalculate his plan based on how much time he has remaining. What is the expected cost that Kyoya will pay to get to school if he moves optimally?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains four integers $ n,m,t,x $ ( $ 2<=n<=50 $ , $ 1<=m<=100 $ , $ 1<=t<=20000 $ , $ 0<=x<=10^{6} $ ).

The next $ 2m $ lines contain the description of the trains.

The $ 2i $ -th line will have $ 3 $ integers $ a_{i},b_{i},c_{i} $ , representing a one way train from station $ a_{i} $ to $ b_{i} $ with ticket cost $ c_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ a_{i}≠b_{i} $ , $ 0<=c_{i}<=10^{6} $ ). There will always be at least one path from any station to the school.

The $ (2i+1) $ -th line will contain $ t $ integers, $ p_{i,1},p_{i,2},...,p_{i,t} $ where $ p_{i,k}/100000 $ is the probability that this train will take $ k $ units of time to traverse ( $ 0<=p_{i,k}<=100000 $ for $ 1<=k<=t $ , ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF553E/c76a22ee61018b4af95225f4e365759ccc0e9dc9.png)).

It is guaranteed that there is no more than one train between each pair of platforms in each of the directions.

### 输出格式

Print a single real number that is equal to an optimal expected cost of getting to school. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .

## 说明

The optimal strategy in the first case is as follows:

First, travel along first train line. With probability $ 1/2 $ Kyoya will take $ 1 $ time unit. Otherwise, Kyoya will take $ 3 $ time units.

If the train takes $ 1 $ time unit, travel along the 4th train line. Kyoya will make it to school in time with probability $ 1/2 $ . Otherwise, if the train takes 3 time units, travel along the 2nd train line. Kyoya will make it to school in time with probability $ 1/10 $ .

Since the cost of all train lines are zero, we can just look at the probability that Kyoya will incur the penalty. The probability that Kyoya will have to pay the penalty is $ 1/2×1/2+1/2×9/10=7/10 $ . We can show that no other strategy is strictly better.

The optimal strategy in the second case is to travel along $ 1→2→4 $ no matter what. Kyoya will incur the penalty with probability $ 3/4 $ , and the cost of the trains is $ 200 $ , thus the expected cost is $ 200.75 $ .
