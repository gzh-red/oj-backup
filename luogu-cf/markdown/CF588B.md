In his store, he has only divisors of positive integer $ n $ (and he has all of them). As a birthday present, Malek wants to give her a lovely number from his store. He wants this number to be as big as possible.

Malek always had issues in math, so he asked for your help. Please tell him what is the biggest lovely number in his store.

## 说明

In first sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the shop. 10 isn't divisible by any perfect square, so 10 is lovely.

In second sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 in the shop. 12 is divisible by $ 4=2^{2} $ , so 12 is not lovely, while 6 is indeed lovely.
