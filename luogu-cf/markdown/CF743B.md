# Chloe and the sequence 

## 题意翻译

给定两个数n,k（n<=50，k

再生成一个长度为2^n-1的数列；

这个数列是这样的：

首先在正中间填上n；

接着在n的两边的正中间填上n-1；

再在两个n-1的两边填上n-2

………………

以此类推。

当n=4，这个数列是这样的：

```

1 2 1 3 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1

```

请你输出第k位上数字的值。

## 题目描述

Chloe, the same as Vladik, is a competitive programmer. She didn't have any problems to get to the olympiad like Vladik, but she was confused by the task proposed on the olympiad.

Let's consider the following algorithm of generating a sequence of integers. Initially we have a sequence consisting of a single element equal to $ 1 $ . Then we perform $ (n-1) $ steps. On each step we take the sequence we've got on the previous step, append it to the end of itself and insert in the middle the minimum positive integer we haven't used before. For example, we get the sequence $ [1,2,1] $ after the first step, the sequence $ [1,2,1,3,1,2,1] $ after the second step.

The task is to find the value of the element with index $ k $ (the elements are numbered from $ 1 $ ) in the obtained sequence, i. e. after $ (n-1) $ steps.

Please help Chloe to solve the problem!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=50 $ , $ 1<=k<=2^{n}-1 $ ).

### 输出格式

Print single integer — the integer at the $ k $ -th position in the obtained sequence.

## 说明

In the first sample the obtained sequence is $ [1,2,1,3,1,2,1] $ . The number on the second position is $ 2 $ .

In the second sample the obtained sequence is $ [1,2,1,3,1,2,1,4,1,2,1,3,1,2,1] $ . The number on the eighth position is $ 4 $ .
