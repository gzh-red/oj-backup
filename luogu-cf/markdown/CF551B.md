## 题意翻译

要把一个字符串a，通过调换一些字符的位置变成字符串k，使得字符串k中含有尽量多的字符串b和字符串c。输出更改后的字符串a，若有多解输出任意一个。

## 题目描述

Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings $ a $ , $ b $ , and $ c $ . He wants to obtain string $ k $ by swapping some letters in $ a $ , so that $ k $ should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to $ b $ or $ c $ as possible. Substring of string $ x $ is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from $ x $ . Two substrings of string $ x $ overlap if there is position $ i $ in string $ x $ occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings $ k $ ?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains string $ a $ , the second line contains string $ b $ , and the third line contains string $ c $ ( $ 1<=|a|,|b|,|c|<=10^{5} $ , where $ |s| $ denotes the length of string $ s $ ).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

It is possible that $ b $ and $ c $ coincide.

### 输出格式

Find one of possible strings $ k $ , as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

## 说明

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either $ b $ or $ c $ on positions $ 1–2 $ ( $ ab $ ), $ 3–4 $ ( $ ab $ ), $ 5–7 $ ( $ aca $ ). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be $ acaababbcc $ .
