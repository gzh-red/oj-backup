# Kolya and Tandem Repeat

## 题目描述

Kolya got string $ s $ for his birthday, the string consists of small English letters. He immediately added $ k $ more characters to the right of the string.

Then Borya came and said that the new string contained a tandem repeat of length $ l $ as a substring. How large could $ l $ be?

See notes for definition of a tandem repeat.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains $ s $ ( $ 1<=|s|<=200 $ ). This string contains only small English letters. The second line contains number $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=200 $ ) — the number of the added characters.

### 输出格式

Print a single number — the maximum length of the tandem repeat that could have occurred in the new string.

## 说明

A tandem repeat of length $ 2n $ is string $ s $ , where for any position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) the following condition fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{i+n} $ .

In the first sample Kolya could obtain a string aabaab, in the second — aaabbbbbb, in the third — abracadabrabracadabra.
