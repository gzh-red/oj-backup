# Levko and Table

## 题意翻译

Levko 很喜欢幻方，他想构造一个长宽都是 $n$ 且每行每列的和都是 $k$ 的幻方，请你帮帮他

## 题目描述

Levko loves tables that consist of $ n $ rows and $ n $ columns very much. He especially loves beautiful tables. A table is beautiful to Levko if the sum of elements in each row and column of the table equals $ k $ .

Unfortunately, he doesn't know any such table. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The single line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ , $ 1<=k<=1000 $ ).

### 输出格式

Print any beautiful table. Levko doesn't like too big numbers, so all elements of the table mustn't exceed $ 1000 $ in their absolute value.

If there are multiple suitable tables, you are allowed to print any of them.
