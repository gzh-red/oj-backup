# Hamming Distance Sum

## 题目描述

Genos needs your help. He was asked to solve the following programming problem by Saitama:

The length of some string $ s $ is denoted $ |s| $ . The Hamming distance between two strings $ s $ and $ t $ of equal length is defined as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF608B/26f9df019bcbe60126623115c0e18c5a58de8eee.png), where $ s_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th character of $ s $ and $ t_{i} $ is the $ i $ -th character of $ t $ . For example, the Hamming distance between string "0011" and string "0110" is $ |0-0|+|0-1|+|1-1|+|1-0|=0+1+0+1=2 $ .

Given two binary strings $ a $ and $ b $ , find the sum of the Hamming distances between $ a $ and all contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains binary string $ a $ ( $ 1<=|a|<=200000 $ ).

The second line of the input contains binary string $ b $ ( $ |a|<=|b|<=200000 $ ).

Both strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the sum of Hamming distances between $ a $ and all contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ .

## 说明

For the first sample case, there are four contiguous substrings of $ b $ of length $ |a| $ : "00", "01", "11", and "11". The distance between "01" and "00" is $ |0-0|+|1-0|=1 $ . The distance between "01" and "01" is $ |0-0|+|1-1|=0 $ . The distance between "01" and "11" is $ |0-1|+|1-1|=1 $ . Last distance counts twice, as there are two occurrences of string "11". The sum of these edit distances is $ 1+0+1+1=3 $ .

The second sample case is described in the statement.
