## 题意翻译

给定一个长度为n的数组,要求把数组分为若干部分满足下面两个条件

(1):每个部分至少含有l个元素

(2):每个部分中两两数的差值的最大值不超过s

问在满足上述两个条件的情况下,最少能分成多少个部分。

## 题目描述

Alexandra has a paper strip with $ n $ numbers on it. Let's call them $ a_{i} $ from left to right.

Now Alexandra wants to split it into some pieces (possibly $ 1 $ ). For each piece of strip, it must satisfy:

- Each piece should contain at least $ l $ numbers.

- The difference between the maximal and the minimal number on the piece should be at most $ s $ .

Please help Alexandra to find the minimal number of pieces meeting the condition above.
