# Power Tower

## 题意翻译

给定一个数列$w_1,w_2,...,w_n$和模数p,每次询问一个区间[l,r],求$w_l^{w_{l+1}^{w_{l+2}^{{...}^{w_r}}}} mod p$的值

如果你看不懂上面的式子，它其实是这样运算的:

$x=w_r$,$x=w_{r-1}^x$,...,$x=w_l^x$

## 题目描述

Priests of the Quetzalcoatl cult want to build a tower to represent a power of their god. Tower is usually made of power-charged rocks. It is built with the help of rare magic by levitating the current top of tower and adding rocks at its bottom. If top, which is built from $ k-1 $ rocks, possesses power $ p $ and we want to add the rock charged with power $ w_{k} $ then value of power of a new tower will be $ {w_{k}}^{p} $ .

Rocks are added from the last to the first. That is for sequence $ w_{1},...,w_{m} $ value of power will be

But still priests want to get some information about it, namely they want to know a number called cumulative power which is the true value of power taken modulo $ m $ . Priests have $ n $ rocks numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . They ask you to calculate which value of cumulative power will the tower possess if they will build it from rocks numbered $ l,l+1,...,r $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains two integers $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) and $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=10^{9} $ ).

Second line of input contains $ n $ integers $ w_{k} $ ( $ 1<=w_{k}<=10^{9} $ ) which is the power of rocks that priests have.

Third line of input contains single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) which is amount of queries from priests to you.

$ k^{th} $ of next $ q $ lines contains two integers $ l_{k} $ and $ r_{k} $ ( $ 1<=l_{k}<=r_{k}<=n $ ).

### 输出格式

Output $ q $ integers. $ k $ -th of them must be the amount of cumulative power the tower will have if is built from rocks $ l_{k},l_{k}+1,...,r_{k} $ .
