# Vladik and cards

## 题意翻译

# 翻译：

题意：给定序列A，A中均元素为$[1,8]$中的整数，求一个A的最长子序列且满足以下2个条件，

1. $[1,8]$中每2个整数的出现次数之差不超过1

2. 每种数字的全部元素必须连续，

即222333是合法的，223322不合法

n<=1000,(2s)

## 题目描述

Vladik was bored on his way home and decided to play the following game. He took $ n $ cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding $ 8 $ written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:

- the number of occurrences of each number from $ 1 $ to $ 8 $ in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then $ 1 $ from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are $ c_{k} $ cards with number $ k $ on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF743E/0c6cc5f621659ae2ddf5ab0dac10dd28e326ec14.png) the condition $ |c_{i}-c_{j}|<=1 $ must hold.

- if there is at least one card with number $ x $ on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number $ x $ in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence $ [1,1,2,2] $ satisfies this condition while the subsequence $ [1,2,2,1] $ doesn't. Note that $ [1,1,2,2] $ doesn't satisfy the first condition.

Please help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=1000 $ ) — the number of cards in Vladik's sequence.

The second line contains the sequence of $ n $ positive integers not exceeding $ 8 $ — the description of Vladik's sequence.

### 输出格式

Print single integer — the length of the longest subsequence of Vladik's sequence that satisfies both conditions.

## 说明

In the first sample all the numbers written on the cards are equal, so you can't take more than one card, otherwise you'll violate the first condition.
