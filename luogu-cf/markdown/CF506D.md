# Mr. Kitayuta&#039;s Colorful Graph

## 题目描述

Mr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m $ edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to $ n $ . Each edge, namely edge $ i $ , has a color $ c_{i} $ , connecting vertex $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ .

Mr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following $ q $ queries.

In the $ i $ -th query, he gives you two integers - $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ .

Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex $ u_{i} $ and vertex $ v_{i} $ directly or indirectly.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains space-separated two integers - $ n $ and $ m(2<=n<=10^{5},1<=m<=10^{5}) $ , denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.

The next $ m $ lines contain space-separated three integers - $ a_{i} $ , $ b_{i}(1<=a_{i}&lt;b_{i}<=n) $ and $ c_{i}(1<=c_{i}<=m) $ . Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if $ i≠j,(a_{i},b_{i},c_{i})≠(a_{j},b_{j},c_{j}) $ .

The next line contains a integer- $ q(1<=q<=10^{5}) $ , denoting the number of the queries.

Then follows $ q $ lines, containing space-separated two integers - $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i}(1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n) $ . It is guaranteed that $ u_{i}≠v_{i} $ .

### 输出格式

For each query, print the answer in a separate line.

## 说明

Let's consider the first sample.

- Vertex $ 3 $ and vertex $ 4 $ are connected by color $ 3 $ .

- Vertex $ 1 $ and vertex $ 4 $ are not connected by any single color.
