CF867A Between the Offices

题意:

就像你知道的那样,MemSQL公司在旧金山和西雅图都有办公室,作为一个经理,你需要经常在两个城市之间乘坐飞机旅行.

你更喜欢从西雅图飞向旧金山的航班,因为会在旅途中逐渐变暖.由于你太忙而搞混了一些航班,然而,在过去的n天里,你清楚地记得你不是在旧金山的办公室就是在西雅图的办公室,并且乘坐的航班都是在晚上,这就造成了你不会同一天待过两个办公室.给你这些信息,判断在过去的n天里,是否乘坐从西雅图飞向旧金山的航班多一些.

输入:

第一行一个整数n(2<=n<=100),表示天数.

第二行长度为n的字符串,只包含'S'和'F'.如果第i个字母是'S',意味着在你的记忆里你那天在西雅图的办公室度过,而'F'意味着你呆在旧金山的办公室一天.给定的序列已经按照日期排好序,且今天是序列的最后一天.

输出:

如果你乘坐从西雅图飞向旧金山的航班更多一些,输出YES,否则输出NO.

样例解释:

样例1:你先是呆在旧金山的办公室,接着飞到了西雅图,两天之后又回到了旧金山,你需要在两个方向都乘坐航班,所以答案为NO.

样例2:你仅仅需要乘坐从西雅图飞向旧金山的航班,所以答案是YES.

样例3:所有的时间里,你都呆在了旧金山,所以答案是NO.

样例4:如果你将S换成1,将F换成0,你将得到π的二进制前几位,虽然这并不是很有用的信息. 

## 题目描述

As you may know, MemSQL has American offices in both San Francisco and Seattle. Being a manager in the company, you travel a lot between the two cities, always by plane.

You prefer flying from Seattle to San Francisco than in the other direction, because it's warmer in San Francisco. You are so busy that you don't remember the number of flights you have made in either direction. However, for each of the last $ n $ days you know whether you were in San Francisco office or in Seattle office. You always fly at nights, so you never were at both offices on the same day. Given this information, determine if you flew more times from Seattle to San Francisco during the last $ n $ days, or not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of days.

The second line contains a string of length $ n $ consisting of only capital 'S' and 'F' letters. If the $ i $ -th letter is 'S', then you were in Seattle office on that day. Otherwise you were in San Francisco. The days are given in chronological order, i.e. today is the last day in this sequence.

### 输出格式

Print "YES" if you flew more times from Seattle to San Francisco, and "NO" otherwise.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

## 说明

In the first example you were initially at San Francisco, then flew to Seattle, were there for two days and returned to San Francisco. You made one flight in each direction, so the answer is "NO".

In the second example you just flew from Seattle to San Francisco, so the answer is "YES".

In the third example you stayed the whole period in San Francisco, so the answer is "NO".

In the fourth example if you replace 'S' with ones, and 'F' with zeros, you'll get the first few digits of $ π $ in binary representation. Not very useful information though.
