# Dima and Salad

## 题意翻译

【问题描述】 有 n 个水果，每个水果有两个属性：美味值和卡路里值。现在选用若干个（至少 1 个）水果制作一份特殊的沙拉，沙拉的美味值为所选的水果的美味值的和，沙拉的卡路里值为所选水果的卡路里值的和。沙拉的美味值恰好是卡路里值的 K 倍。请计算该沙拉美味值最大为多少。

【输入数据】第一行，两个整数 n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10)；

第二行，包含 n 个整数，a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100)，表示水果的美味值；

第三行，包含 n 个整数，b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100)，表示水果的卡路里值。

【输出数据】共一行，一个整数，表示最大美味值，若无解则输出-1。

## 题目描述

Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something.

Dima and Seryozha have $ n $ fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal $ k $ . In other words, ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF366C/f07d6e1f143f8d1fae686d3a2981d314f5a5105a.png) , where $ a_{j} $ is the taste of the $ j $ -th chosen fruit and $ b_{j} $ is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n<=100,1<=k<=10) $ . The second line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=100) $ — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains $ n $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n} $ $ (1<=b_{i}<=100) $ — the fruits' calories. Fruit number $ i $ has taste $ a_{i} $ and calories $ b_{i} $ .

### 输出格式

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

## 说明

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF366C/ce55a230ecc0a3ebd10e969b3c18a14fbf3f32d3.png) fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.
