# Restoring Map

## 题意翻译

题目描述

有一棵$n$个点的树。定义某一个点树上的邻居为与其距离不超过$2$的点（包括它自己）。现在，给出$n$个点的邻居，顺序是打乱的，请你复原这一棵树。

输入格式

第一行一个正整数$n(2 \leq n \leq 1000)$表示树的点数

接下来$n$行每行第一个数$k(1 \leq k \leq n)$，接着$k$个数描述树上一个点的邻居。

输出格式

输出$n-1$行，每行两个整数$a_i,b_i(1 \leq a_i , b_i \leq n , a_i \neq b_i)$描述树上的一条边。如果有多种方案满足题意，输出任意一种即可。

## 题目描述

Archaeologists found some information about an ancient land of Treeland. We know for sure that the Treeland consisted of $ n $ cities connected by the $ n-1 $ road, such that you can get from each city to any other one along the roads. However, the information about the specific design of roads in Treeland has been lost. The only thing that the archaeologists can use is the preserved information about near cities.

Two cities of Treeland were called near, if it were possible to move from one city to the other one by moving through at most two roads. Also, a city is considered near to itself. During the recent excavations archaeologists found a set of $ n $ notes, each of them represents a list of cities, near to some of the $ n $ cities of the country. However, unfortunately, none of the found records lets you understand in what order the cities go in the list and for which city in the list the near to it cities were listed.

Help the archaeologists and restore any variant of the map of Treeland that meets the found information.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=1000 $ ) — the number of cities in the country.

Next $ n $ lines describe the found lists of near cities. Each list starts from number $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ), representing the number of cities in the list followed by $ k $ city numbers. All numbers in each list are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the given information determines at least one possible road map.

### 输出格式

Print $ n-1 $ pairs of numbers representing the roads of the country. The $ i $ -th line must contain two integers $ a_{i},b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ , $ a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ), showing that there is a road between cities $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ .

The answer you print must satisfy the description of close cities from the input. You may print the roads of the countries in any order. The cities that are connected by a road may also be printed in any order.

If there are multiple good answers, you may print any of them.
