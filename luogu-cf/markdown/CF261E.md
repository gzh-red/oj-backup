# Maxim and Calculator

## 题意翻译

二元组$ (a,b)$,可以变成$ (a,b+1)$或$ (ab,b)$

你有初始二元组$ (1,0)$,给你区间$ [l,r]$,和一个整数$ p$,在区间内选一个数$ x$,使$ (1,0)$在不超过$ p$步变化后,第一维的值变成$ x$,求$ x$的个数

## 题目描述

Maxim has got a calculator. The calculator has two integer cells. Initially, the first cell contains number $ 1 $ , and the second cell contains number $ 0 $ . In one move you can perform one of the following operations:

1. Let's assume that at the current time the first cell contains number $ a $ , and the second cell contains number $ b $ . Write to the second cell number $ b+1 $ ;

2. Let's assume that at the current time the first cell contains number $ a $ , and the second cell contains number $ b $ . Write to the first cell number $ a·b $ .

Maxim is wondering, how many integers $ x $ $ (l<=x<=r) $ are there, such that we can write the number $ x $ to the first cell of the calculator, having performed at most $ p $ moves.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains three integers: $ l $ , $ r $ , $ p $ $ (2<=l<=r<=10^{9},1<=p<=100) $ .

The numbers in the line are separated by single spaces.

### 输出格式

In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
