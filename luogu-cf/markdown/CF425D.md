# Sereja and Squares

## 题目描述

Sereja has painted $ n $ distinct points on the plane. The coordinates of each point are integers. Now he is wondering: how many squares are there with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with points painted in all its four vertexes? Help him, calculate this number.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ . Each of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_{i},y_{i} $ $ (0<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10^{5}) $ , the integers represent the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point. It is guaranteed that all the given points are distinct.

### 输出格式

In a single line print the required number of squares.
