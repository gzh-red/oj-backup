# Phone Numbers

## 题意翻译

给出一个数字串表示你已经有的数字卡片.现在请问你用这些卡片最多能摆出多少个电话号码.

注意:卡片不能重复使用.电话号码是一个开头为$8$的$11$位数字.

## 题目描述

Let's call a string a phone number if it has length 11 and fits the pattern "8xxxxxxxxxx", where each "x" is replaced by a digit.

For example, "80123456789" and "80000000000" are phone numbers, while "8012345678" and "79000000000" are not.

You have $ n $ cards with digits, and you want to use them to make as many phone numbers as possible. Each card must be used in at most one phone number, and you don't have to use all cards. The phone numbers do not necessarily have to be distinct.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ n $ — the number of cards with digits that you have ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 100 $ ).

The second line contains a string of $ n $ digits (characters "0", "1", ..., "9") $ s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n $ . The string will not contain any other characters, such as leading or trailing spaces.

### 输出格式

If at least one phone number can be made from these cards, output the maximum number of phone numbers that can be made. Otherwise, output 0.
