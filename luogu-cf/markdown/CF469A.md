# I Wanna Be the Guy

## 题意翻译

小X和小Y最近在玩一个叫做I wanna be the guy的游戏，这个游戏有$n$个关卡。把$n$个关卡都通过后，那么就完成游戏了。

可是小X只能过$p$关，小Y只能过$q$关。因为他们能力有限，所以他们决定合作。

## 题目描述

There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of $ n $ levels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.

Little X can pass only $ p $ levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only $ q $ levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ).

The next line contains an integer $ p $ $ (0<=p<=n) $ at first, then follows $ p $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{p} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=n) $ . These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ .

### 输出格式

If they can pass all the levels, print "I become the guy.". If it's impossible, print "Oh, my keyboard!" (without the quotes).
