# Polycarpus is Looking for Good Substrings

## 题目描述

We'll call string $ s[a,b]=s_{a}s_{a+1}...\ s_{b} $ $ (1<=a<=b<=|s|) $ a substring of string $ s=s_{1}s_{2}...\ s_{|s|} $ , where $ |s| $ is the length of string $ s $ .

The trace of a non-empty string $ t $ is a set of characters that the string consists of. For example, the trace of string "aab" equals {'a', 'b'}.

Let's consider an arbitrary string $ s $ and the set of its substrings with trace equal to $ C $ . We will denote the number of substrings from this set that are maximal by inclusion by $ r(C,s) $ . Substring $ s[a,b] $ of length $ n=b-a+1 $ belonging to some set is called maximal by inclusion, if there is no substring $ s[x,y] $ in this set with length greater than $ n $ , such that $ 1<=x<=a<=b<=y<=|s| $ . Two substrings of string $ s $ are considered different even if they are equal but they are located at different positions of $ s $ .

Polycarpus got a challenging practical task on a stringology exam. He must do the following: given string $ s $ and non-empty sets of characters $ C_{1} $ , $ C_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ C_{m} $ , find $ r(C_{i},s) $ for each set $ C_{i} $ . Help Polycarpus to solve the problem as he really doesn't want to be expelled from the university and go to the army!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a non-empty string $ s $ $ (1<=|s|<=10^{6}) $ .

The second line contains a single integer $ m $ $ (1<=m<=10^{4}) $ . Next $ m $ lines contain descriptions of sets $ C_{i} $ . The $ i $ -th line contains string $ c_{i} $ such that its trace equals $ C_{i} $ . It is guaranteed that all characters of each string $ c_{i} $ are different.

Note that $ C_{i} $ are not necessarily different. All given strings consist of lowercase English letters.

### 输出格式

Print $ m $ integers — the $ i $ -th integer must equal $ r(C_{i},s) $ .
