# Eugeny and Play List

## 题目描述

Eugeny loves listening to music. He has $ n $ songs in his play list. We know that song number $ i $ has the duration of $ t_{i} $ minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number $ i $ $ c_{i} $ times. Eugeny's play list is organized as follows: first song number $ 1 $ plays $ c_{1} $ times, then song number $ 2 $ plays $ c_{2} $ times, $ ... $ , in the end the song number $ n $ plays $ c_{n} $ times.

Eugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out $ m $ moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment $ x $ means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the $ x $ -th minute of his listening to the play list.

Help Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5}) $ . The next $ n $ lines contain pairs of integers. The $ i $ -th line contains integers $ c_{i},t_{i} $ $ (1<=c_{i},t_{i}<=10^{9}) $ — the description of the play list. It is guaranteed that the play list's total duration doesn't exceed $ 10^{9} $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF302B/df3f73f4944d83eb87e4ddce98d78d31bcd35cf4.png).

The next line contains $ m $ positive integers $ v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{m} $ , that describe the moments Eugeny has written out. It is guaranteed that there isn't such moment of time $ v_{i} $ , when the music doesn't play any longer. It is guaranteed that $ v_{i}&lt;v_{i+1} $ $ (i&lt;m) $ .

The moment of time $ v_{i} $ means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the $ v_{i} $ -th munite from the start of listening to the playlist.

### 输出格式

Print $ m $ integers — the $ i $ -th number must equal the number of the song that was playing during the $ v_{i} $ -th minute after Eugeny started listening to the play list.
