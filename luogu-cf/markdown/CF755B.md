## 题目描述

PolandBall is playing a game with EnemyBall. The rules are simple. Players have to say words in turns. You cannot say a word which was already said. PolandBall starts. The Ball which can't say a new word loses.

You're given two lists of words familiar to PolandBall and EnemyBall. Can you determine who wins the game, if both play optimally?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first input line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=10^{3} $ ) — number of words PolandBall and EnemyBall know, respectively.

Then $ n $ strings follow, one per line — words familiar to PolandBall.

Then $ m $ strings follow, one per line — words familiar to EnemyBall.

Note that one Ball cannot know a word more than once (strings are unique), but some words can be known by both players.

Each word is non-empty and consists of no more than $ 500 $ lowercase English alphabet letters.

### 输出格式

In a single line of print the answer — "YES" if PolandBall wins and "NO" otherwise. Both Balls play optimally.
