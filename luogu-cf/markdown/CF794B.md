# Cutting Carrot

## 题目描述

Igor the analyst has adopted $ n $ little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into $ n $ pieces of equal area.

Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to $ 1 $ and height equal to $ h $ . Igor wants to make $ n-1 $ cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into $ n $ pieces. He wants to make sure that all $ n $ pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers, $ n $ and $ h $ ( $ 2<=n<=1000 $ , $ 1<=h<=10^{5} $ ).

### 输出格式

The output should contain $ n-1 $ real numbers $ x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n-1} $ . The number $ x_{i} $ denotes that the $ i $ -th cut must be made $ x_{i} $ units away from the apex of the carrot. In addition, $ 0&lt;x_{1}&lt;x_{2}&lt;...&lt;x_{n-1}&lt;h $ must hold.

Your output will be considered correct if absolute or relative error of every number in your output doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .

Formally, let your answer be $ a $ , and the jury's answer be $ b $ . Your answer is considered correct if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF794B/259203790d90e969d73ec841bd0673c1e8e7d69a.png).
