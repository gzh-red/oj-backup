# Bash Plays with Functions

## 题意翻译

定义函数$f_r(n)$在r=0时为整数对(p,q)满足p*q=n且gcd(p,q)=1的有序对(p,q)个数,在$r\ge1$时$f_r(n)=\sum_{u*v=n}\frac{f_{r-1}(u)+f_{r-1}(v)}{2}$

​

一共q组询问, 每组询问给出r,n,求$f_r(n)$模 10^9+7的结果.

$q\le10^6$,$0\le r\le10^6$,$1\le n\le10^6$

## 题目描述

Bash got tired on his journey to become the greatest Pokemon master. So he decides to take a break and play with functions.

Bash defines a function $ f_{0}(n) $ , which denotes the number of ways of factoring $ n $ into two factors $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ . In other words, $ f_{0}(n) $ is the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $ (p,q) $ such that $ p·q=n $ and $ gcd(p,q)=1 $ .

But Bash felt that it was too easy to calculate this function. So he defined a series of functions, where $ f_{r+1} $ is defined as:

Now Bash wants to know the value of $ f_{r}(n) $ for different $ r $ and $ n $ . Since the value could be huge, he would like to know the value modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ . Help him!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=10^{6} $ ) — the number of values Bash wants to know.

Each of the next $ q $ lines contain two integers $ r $ and $ n $ ( $ 0<=r<=10^{6} $ , $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ), which denote Bash wants to know the value $ f_{r}(n) $ .

### 输出格式

Print $ q $ integers. For each pair of $ r $ and $ n $ given, print $ f_{r}(n) $ modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ on a separate line.
