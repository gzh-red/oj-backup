## 题意翻译

有一棵树，共有N($ 1<=n<=10^5$)个节点，他会使用下列DFS算法对该树进行遍历。

```

starting_time是一个容量为n的数组

current_time = 0

dfs(v):

current_time =current_time+1

starting_time[v] = current_time

将children[v]的顺序随机排列 (每个排列的概率相同)

// children[v]v的直接儿子组成的数组

for u in children[v]:

dfs(u)

```

1是这棵树的根，Bob会从1出发，即运行dfs(1)，现在他想知道每个点starting_time的期望值。

## 题目描述

Barney lives in country USC (United States of Charzeh). USC has $ n $ cities numbered from $ 1 $ through $ n $ and $ n-1 $ roads between them. Cities and roads of USC form a rooted tree (Barney's not sure why it is rooted). Root of the tree is the city number $ 1 $ . Thus if one will start his journey from city $ 1 $ , he can visit any city he wants by following roads.

He starts looking for in the root of the tree and (since he is Barney Stinson not a random guy), he uses a random DFS to search in the cities. A pseudo code of this algorithm is as follows:

`let starting_time be an array of length ncurrent_time = 0dfs(v): current_time = current_time + 1 starting_time[v] = current_time shuffle children[v] randomly (each permutation with equal possibility) // children[v] is vector of children cities of city v for u in children[v]: dfs(u)`As told before, Barney will start his journey in the root of the tree (equivalent to call dfs(1)).

Now Barney needs to pack a backpack and so he wants to know more about his upcoming journey: for every city $ i $ , Barney wants to know the expected value of starting\_time\[i\]. He's a friend of Jon Snow and knows nothing, that's why he asked for your help.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of cities in USC.

The second line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}&lt;i $ ), where $ p_{i} $ is the number of the parent city of city number $ i $ in the tree, meaning there is a road between cities numbered $ p_{i} $ and $ i $ in USC.

### 输出格式

In the first and only line of output print $ n $ numbers, where $ i $ -th number is the expected value of starting\_time\[i\].

Your answer for each city will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .
