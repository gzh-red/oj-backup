## 题目描述

Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ is a pair of indexes $ i,j $ $ (1<=i<ja_{j} $ holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence $ p $ by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=2000) $ . The next line contains $ n $ integers — sequence $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ p_{n} $ $ (|p_{i}|<=10^{5}) $ . The numbers are separated by spaces.

### 输出格式

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.
