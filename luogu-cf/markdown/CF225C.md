## 题意翻译

Description

给出一n×mn×m的矩阵，初始有颜色，..表示白色，##表示黑色，要求修改最少位置的颜色使得满足以下两个条件：

1.每列颜色相同

2.连续相同颜色的列数介于x,yx,y之间

Input

第一行四个整数n,m,x,yn,m,x,y，之后输入初始颜色状态(1≤n,m,x,y≤1000,x≤y)(1≤n,m,x,y≤1000,x≤y)

Output

输出最少需要修改颜色的位置数

## 题目描述

You've got an $ n×m $ pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- All pixels in each column are of the same color.

- The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least $ x $ and at most $ y $ pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than $ x $ or greater than $ y $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains four space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=n,m,x,y<=1000; x<=y $ ).

Then follow $ n $ lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly $ m $ characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "\#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "\#".

### 输出格式

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

## 说明

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows:

`.##...##...##...##...##...##..`In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows:

`.#.#..#.#.`
