## 题目描述

Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Entrance $ n $ and entrance $ 1 $ are adjacent.

Today Vasya got bored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance $ a $ and he decided that during his walk he will move around the house $ b $ entrances in the direction of increasing numbers (in this order entrance $ n $ should be followed by entrance $ 1 $ ). The negative value of $ b $ corresponds to moving $ |b| $ entrances in the order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance $ 1 $ is followed by entrance $ n $ ). If $ b=0 $ , then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The single line of the input contains three space-separated integers $ n $ , $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1<=n<=100,1<=a<=n,-100<=b<=100 $ ) — the number of entrances at Vasya's place, the number of his entrance and the length of his walk, respectively.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n $ ) — the number of the entrance where Vasya will be at the end of his walk.
