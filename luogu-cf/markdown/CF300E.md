## 题意翻译

给定k个数$a_1$,$a_2$...$a_k$，求一个数p=n!使得p能被$\prod_{i=1}^ka_i!$整除。

## 题目描述

In a far away galaxy there is war again. The treacherous Republic made $ k $ precision strikes of power $ a_{i} $ on the Empire possessions. To cope with the republican threat, the Supreme Council decided to deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces.

The balance of confrontation is a number that looks like ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300E/ae456f9650d5b3ca46e54c303d07fec088f6ad5e.png), where $ p=n! $ ( $ n $ is the power of the Imperial strike), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF300E/99b314c14cf87aaec7902ee9933ec2e853964496.png). After many years of war the Empire's resources are low. So to reduce the costs, $ n $ should be a minimum positive integer that is approved by the commanders.

Help the Empire, find the minimum positive integer $ n $ , where the described fraction is a positive integer.
