# Odds and Ends

## 题意翻译

给你一个数列a${_1}$,a${_2}$,……,a${_n}$

现在要求你把这个数列分成奇数个子数列，每个子数列都有奇数个数字，且每个数列的第一个与最后一个必须是奇数

问你能不能做到，能做到输出Yes，不能则输出No

## 题目描述

Where do odds begin, and where do they end? Where does hope emerge, and will they ever break?

Given an integer sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ of length $ n $ . Decide whether it is possible to divide it into an odd number of non-empty subsegments, the each of which has an odd length and begins and ends with odd numbers.

A subsegment is a contiguous slice of the whole sequence. For example, $ {3,4,5} $ and $ {1} $ are subsegments of sequence $ {1,2,3,4,5,6} $ , while $ {1,2,4} $ and $ {7} $ are not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains a non-negative integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains $ n $ space-separated non-negative integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 0<=a_{i}<=100 $ ) — the elements of the sequence.

### 输出格式

Output "Yes" if it's possible to fulfill the requirements, and "No" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).

## 说明

In the first example, divide the sequence into $ 1 $ subsegment: $ {1,3,5} $ and the requirements will be met.

In the second example, divide the sequence into $ 3 $ subsegments: $ {1,0,1} $ , $ {5} $ , $ {1} $ .

In the third example, one of the subsegments must start with $ 4 $ which is an even number, thus the requirements cannot be met.

In the fourth example, the sequence can be divided into $ 2 $ subsegments: $ {3,9,9} $ , $ {3} $ , but this is not a valid solution because $ 2 $ is an even number.
