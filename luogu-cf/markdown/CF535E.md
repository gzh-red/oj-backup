# Tavas and Pashmaks

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

现在有两个比赛项目:跑步和游泳.每一个人在这两个项目都有一个正整数的值,第i个人分别为$a_i,b_i$,表示他在这个项目上的速度.

我们假定游泳的距离为$S_1$,跑步的距离为$S_2$(都是**正实数**),知道每一个人的值,如果对于第i个人,存在这样子的$S_1$和$S_2$使得$S_1/a_i+S_2/b_i<=S_1/a_j+S_2/b_j(1<=j<=n)$,那么就称这个人可以夺冠.

求出有多少个人可以夺冠.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式：

第$1$行一个正整数$n$,表示有$n$个人.

第$2$~$n+1$,每行有$2$个正整数分别表示每一个人在跑步和游泳上的速度.

### 输出格式：

一行,输出所有可以夺冠的人.

## 题目描述

Tavas is a cheerleader in the new sports competition named "Pashmaks".

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF535E/0b6da36d56bf0a246e5aa7cfd5aed357a77c0b48.png)This competition consists of two part: swimming and then running. People will immediately start running $ R $ meters after they finished swimming exactly $ S $ meters. A winner is a such person that nobody else finishes running before him/her (there may be more than one winner).

Before the match starts, Tavas knows that there are $ n $ competitors registered for the match. Also, he knows that $ i $ -th person's swimming speed is $ s_{i} $ meters per second and his/her running speed is $ r_{i} $ meters per second. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the values of $ R $ and $ S $ , but he knows that they are real numbers greater than $ 0 $ .

As a cheerleader, Tavas wants to know who to cheer up. So, he wants to know all people that might win. We consider a competitor might win if and only if there are some values of $ R $ and $ S $ such that with these values, (s)he will be a winner.

Tavas isn't really familiar with programming, so he asked you to help him.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=2×10^{5} $ ).

The next $ n $ lines contain the details of competitors. $ i $ -th line contains two integers $ s_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=s_{i},r_{i}<=10^{4} $ ).

### 输出格式

In the first and the only line of output, print a sequence of numbers of possible winners in increasing order.
