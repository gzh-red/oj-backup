# New Year Domino

## 题意翻译

有n个多米诺骨牌，从左到右排列，每一个骨牌都有一个高度Li，向右推倒，它会直接向右倒下，如下图，倒下后该骨牌的顶端落在Xi+Li的位置，（Xi是它位于的坐标，即倒下时该骨牌不会发生移动）

在倒下过程中，骨牌会碰到其他骨牌，碰到的骨牌会向右倒，如下图，最左边的骨牌倒下会碰倒A,B,C，A,B,C会倒下，但是不会直接碰到D，但是D会因为C的倒下而碰倒。

现在给你N个骨牌的坐标Xi，和每个骨牌的高度Li。则一个骨牌能碰倒另一个骨牌当切仅当xi+li≥xj。同时有Q个询问 [L,R]，问向右推到第L个骨牌，最少需要多少代价让R倒下。你可以临时增加某个骨牌的高度，增加1个高度的代价是1.

## 题目描述

Celebrating the new year, many people post videos of falling dominoes; Here's a list of them: https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=New+Years+Dominos

User ainta, who lives in a 2D world, is going to post a video as well.

There are $ n $ dominoes on a 2D Cartesian plane. $ i $ -th domino ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) can be represented as a line segment which is parallel to the $ y $ -axis and whose length is $ l_{i} $ . The lower point of the domino is on the $ x $ -axis. Let's denote the $ x $ -coordinate of the $ i $ -th domino as $ p_{i} $ . Dominoes are placed one after another, so $ p_{1}&lt;p_{2}&lt;...&lt;p_{n-1}&lt;p_{n} $ holds.

User ainta wants to take a video of falling dominoes. To make dominoes fall, he can push a single domino to the right. Then, the domino will fall down drawing a circle-shaped orbit until the line segment totally overlaps with the x-axis.

Domino $ s $ touches domino $ t $ if and only if the segment representing $ s $ and $ t $ intersects.

If he pushes the leftmost domino to the right, it falls down, touching dominoes (A), (B) and (C). As a result, dominoes (A), (B), (C) will also fall towards the right. However, domino (D) won't be affected by pushing the leftmost domino, but eventually it will fall because it is touched by domino (C) for the first time.

User ainta has $ q $ plans of posting the video. $ j $ -th of them starts with pushing the $ x_{j} $ -th domino, and lasts until the $ y_{j} $ -th domino falls. But sometimes, it could be impossible to achieve such plan, so he has to lengthen some dominoes. It costs one dollar to increase the length of a single domino by $ 1 $ . User ainta wants to know, for each plan, the minimum cost needed to achieve it. Plans are processed independently, i. e. if domino's length is increased in some plan, it doesn't affect its length in other plans. Set of dominos that will fall except $ x_{j} $ -th domino and $ y_{j} $ -th domino doesn't matter, but the initial push should be on domino $ x_{j} $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=2×10^{5} $ )— the number of dominoes.

Next $ n $ lines describe the dominoes. The $ i $ -th line ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) contains two space-separated integers $ p_{i} $ , $ l_{i} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i},l_{i}<=10^{9} $ )— the $ x $ -coordinate and the length of the $ i $ -th domino. It is guaranteed that $ p_{1}&lt;p_{2}&lt;...&lt;p_{n-1}&lt;p_{n} $ .

The next line contains an integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=2×10^{5} $ ) — the number of plans.

Next $ q $ lines describe the plans. The $ j $ -th line ( $ 1<=j<=q $ ) contains two space-separated integers $ x_{j} $ , $ y_{j} $ ( $ 1<=x_{j}&lt;y_{j}<=n $ ). It means the $ j $ -th plan is, to push the $ x_{j} $ -th domino, and shoot a video until the $ y_{j} $ -th domino falls.

### 输出格式

For each plan, print a line containing the minimum cost needed to achieve it. If no cost is needed, print 0.

## 说明

Consider the example. The dominoes are set like the picture below.

To make the 6th domino fall by pushing the 2nd domino, the length of the 3rd domino (whose x-coordinate is 4) should be increased by 1, and the 5th domino (whose x-coordinate is 9) should be increased by 1 (other option is to increase 4th domino instead of 5th also by 1). Then, the dominoes will fall like in the picture below. Each cross denotes a touch between two dominoes.
