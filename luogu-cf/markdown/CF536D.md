# Tavas in Kansas

## 题意翻译

Tavas住在堪萨斯州。堪萨斯州有$n$个城市（标号从1到$n$）通过$m$条双向道路互相联通。任意两个城市可以通过这些道路互相到达。可能存在**自环**和**重边**。

Tavas发明了一项叫做"Dashti"的游戏。他想和他的女朋友Nafas一起来玩这个游戏。在这个游戏里，他们给堪萨斯州的每一个城市分配了一个任意整数权值。第$i$个城市的权值是$p_i$。

游戏开始，Tavas在城市$s$而Nafas在城市$t$。他们轮流进行操作，Tavas先手。每人每一轮必须选择一个非负整数$x$并将所有与当前他/她所在的城市最短距离不超过$x$的城市的权值和加到他/她的得分中。每个城市的权值只能被获取一次，换句话说，当玩家第一次从这个城市获取分数后，它上面的权值将会变成0。

还有一项规则：玩家选择的$x$必须使得他/她从至少一个之前没有取过的城市获取得分。注意有些城市可能一开始的权值就是0，但这些城市一开始也被视为没有获取过，玩家如果第一次取到这个城市也能满足这项规则。

当没有玩家能进行操作后，游戏结束。得分高者获胜，两人分数相等时平局。每个人开局时得分都为0。

如果Tavas赢了，他会伤了女朋友的心，但如果Nafas赢了，Tavas会哭。但如果他们平手了，他们两人都会很开心，Tavas还会给Nafas送花。

但他们两人并不是很感性，所以他们都会执行最优策略。你的任务是去告诉Tavas最终结果是什么。

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

输入的第一行包含两个整数$n,m(2\le n\le 2000,n-1\le m\le 10^5)$.

第二行包含两个整数$s,t(1\le s,t\le n,s\neq t)$

下一行包含$n$个整数$p_1,p_2,...,p_n$，两个数之间由空格隔开$(|p_i|\le 10^9)$.

下面$m$行给出道路的信息。每一行包含三个整数$v,u,w$，表示$u,v$之间有一条长度为$w$的无向边$(1\le u,v\le n,0\le w\le 10^9)$。注意可能是自环和重边。

### 输出格式

如果Tavas赢了，输出"Break a heart".如果Nafas赢了，输出"Cry"。如果平局了，输出"Flowers"。

## 题目描述

Tavas lives in Kansas. Kansas has $ n $ cities numbered from 1 to $ n $ connected with $ m $ bidirectional roads. We can travel from any city to any other city via these roads. Kansas is as strange as Tavas. So there may be a road between a city and itself or more than one road between two cities.

Tavas invented a game and called it "Dashti". He wants to play Dashti with his girlfriends, Nafas.

In this game, they assign an arbitrary integer value to each city of Kansas. The value of $ i $ -th city equals to $ p_{i} $ .

During the game, Tavas is in city $ s $ and Nafas is in city $ t $ . They play in turn and Tavas goes first. A player in his/her turn, must choose a non-negative integer $ x $ and his/her score increases by the sum of values of all cities with (shortest) distance no more than $ x $ from his/her city. Each city may be used once, or in the other words, after first time a player gets score from a city, city score becomes zero.

There is an additional rule: the player must choose $ x $ such that he/she gets the point of at least one city that was not used before. Note that city may initially have value 0, such city isn't considered as been used at the beginning of the game, i. e. each player may use it to fullfill this rule.

The game ends when nobody can make a move.

A player's score is the sum of the points he/she earned during the game. The winner is the player with greater score, or there is a draw if players score the same value. Both players start game with zero points.

They're not too emotional after all, so they'll play optimally. Your task is to tell Tavas what's going to happen after the game ends.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=2000 $ , $ n-1<=m<=10^{5} $ ).

The second line of input contains two integers $ s $ and $ t $ ( $ 1<=s,t<=n $ , $ s≠t $ ).

The next line contains $ n $ integers $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ separated by spaces ( $ |p_{i}|<=10^{9} $ ).

The next $ m $ lines contain the roads. Each line contains three integers $ v,u,w $ and it means that there's an road with length $ w $ between cities $ v $ and $ u $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ and $ 0<=w<=10^{9} $ ). The road may lead from the city to itself, there may be several roads between each pair of cities.

### 输出格式

If Tavas wins, print "Break a heart". If Nafas wins print "Cry" and if nobody wins (i. e. the game ended with draw) print "Flowers".
