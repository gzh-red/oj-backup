## 题目描述

During the winter holidays, the demand for Christmas balls is exceptionally high. Since it's already $ 2018 $ , the advances in alchemy allow easy and efficient ball creation by utilizing magic crystals.

Grisha needs to obtain some yellow, green and blue balls. It's known that to produce a yellow ball one needs two yellow crystals, green — one yellow and one blue, and for a blue ball, three blue crystals are enough.

Right now there are $ A $ yellow and $ B $ blue crystals in Grisha's disposal. Find out how many additional crystals he should acquire in order to produce the required number of balls.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式
