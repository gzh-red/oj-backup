## 题目描述

We often go to supermarkets to buy some fruits or vegetables, and on the tag there prints the price for a kilo. But in some supermarkets, when asked how much the items are, the clerk will say that $ a $ yuan for $ b $ kilos (You don't need to care about what "yuan" is), the same as $ a/b $ yuan for a kilo.

Now imagine you'd like to buy $ m $ kilos of apples. You've asked $ n $ supermarkets and got the prices. Find the minimum cost for those apples.

You can assume that there are enough apples in all supermarkets.
