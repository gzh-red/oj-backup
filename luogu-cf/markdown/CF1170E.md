# Sliding Doors

## 题意翻译

**本题仅允许使用`kotlin`提交**

你有一个柜子，这个柜子有$m$个宽度都为$1$的格子，不妨将他们从$1$到$m$编号。

同时柜子上有$n$个推拉门，不妨将他们从$1$到$n$编号。

每扇门的宽度为$a_i$，同时，因为它们在一个轨道上，所以它们不能交叉地移动，也就是说无论何时，从左到右每一扇门的编号都是$1$到$n$递增的。

给出$q$次询问，每次询问会给出$c_k$个整数$w_1\dots w_{c_k}$，你需要回答是否存在一种方案使得这些位置上的格子都没有被门挡住。

## 题目描述

Imagine that you are the CEO of a big old-fashioned company. Unlike any modern and progressive company (such as JetBrains), your company has a dress code. That's why you have already allocated a spacious room for your employees where they can change their clothes. Moreover, you've already purchased an $ m $ -compartment wardrobe, so the $ i $ -th employee can keep his/her belongings in the $ i $ -th cell (of course, all compartments have equal widths).

The issue has occurred: the wardrobe has sliding doors! More specifically, the wardrobe has $ n $ doors (numbered from left to right) and the $ j $ -th door has width equal to $ a_j $ wardrobe's cells. The wardrobe has single rails so that no two doors can slide past each other.

For example, if you have a $ 4 $ -compartment wardrobe (i.e. $ m=4 $ ) with $ n=2 $ one-cell doors (i.e. $ a_1=a_2=1 $ ) and you need to open the $ 1 $ -st and the $ 3 $ -rd cells, you have to close the $ 2 $ -nd and the $ 4 $ -th cells.

As CEO, you have a complete schedule for the next $ q $ days. Now you are wondering: is it possible that all employees who will come on the $ k $ -th day can access their cells simultaneously?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le m \le 4 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of doors and compartments respectively.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le m $ , $ \sum{a_i} \le m $ ) — the corresponding widths of the doors.

The third line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of days you have to process.

The next $ q $ lines describe schedule of each day. Each schedule is represented as an integer $ c_k $ followed by $ c_k $ integers $ w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{c_k} $ ( $ 1 \le c_k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le w_1 < w_2 < \dots < w_{c_k} \le m $ ) — the number of employees who will come on the $ k $ -th day, and their indices in ascending order.

It's guaranteed that $ \sum{c_k} $ doesn't exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

### 输出格式

Print $ q $ answers. Each answer is "YES" or "NO" (case insensitive). Print "YES" if it is possible, that all employees on the corresponding day can access their compartments simultaneously.
