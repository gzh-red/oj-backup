# A Lot of Games

## 题意翻译

Andrew,Fedor和Alex是三个善于创造的人。现在，他们发明了一种字符串双人游戏。

给出n个非空字符串。在游戏中，两位玩家一起建造一个单词。开始时，单词是一个空字符串。两位玩家轮流操作。一位玩家在他的回合中，必须在单词的后面添加一个字母，使得添加后的单词是n个字符串中至少一个的前缀。当一位玩家不能操作时，他就输掉了游戏。

Andrew和Alex决定玩k次。上一局的负者是下一局的先手。他们决定，在最后一局中获胜的人获得整场游戏的胜利。Andrew和Alex已经开始玩了，Fedor想知道，如果他们两个足够聪明，谁会胜利。

## 题目描述

Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of $ n $ non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game $ k $ times. The player who is the loser of the $ i $ -th game makes the first move in the $ (i+1) $ -th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last ( $ k $ -th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.
