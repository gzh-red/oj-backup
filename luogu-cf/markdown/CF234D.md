## 题意翻译

总的来说，Berland有很多男演员。每个参与者都有一个从1到m的整数作为标识符（不同的参与者有不同的标识符）。Vasya喜欢和伯兰演员一起看Berland的电影，他有k个最喜欢的演员。他观看了下个月的电影预告片，并为每部电影写了以下信息：电影标题、主演的演员数量以及这些演员的标识符。此外，他设法复制了电影片名以及有多少演员在那里主演，但是他没有写下某些演员的标识符。Vasya看着他的唱片，想知道哪些电影是他最喜欢的，哪些不是。一旦Vasya知道了所有电影的确切演员，他最喜欢的电影将确定如下：如果从Vasya的名单中没有比其他电影有更多的最喜欢的演员，这一部电影将成为最喜欢的电影。

- 帮助Vasya确定每部电影的以下内容：

1. 它是否肯定是他最喜欢的电影；

2. 它是否肯定不会是他最喜欢的电影；

3. 它是否可以是喜欢也可以不喜欢。

## 题目描述

Overall there are $ m $ actors in Berland. Each actor has a personal identifier — an integer from $ 1 $ to $ m $ (distinct actors have distinct identifiers). Vasya likes to watch Berland movies with Berland actors, and he has $ k $ favorite actors. He watched the movie trailers for the next month and wrote the following information for every movie: the movie title, the number of actors who starred in it, and the identifiers of these actors. Besides, he managed to copy the movie titles and how many actors starred there, but he didn't manage to write down the identifiers of some actors. Vasya looks at his records and wonders which movies may be his favourite, and which ones may not be. Once Vasya learns the exact cast of all movies, his favorite movies will be determined as follows: a movie becomes favorite movie, if no other movie from Vasya's list has more favorite actors.

Help the boy to determine the following for each movie:

- whether it surely will be his favourite movie;

- whether it surely won't be his favourite movie;

- can either be favourite or not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ m $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=m<=100,1<=k<=m $ ) — the number of actors in Berland and the number of Vasya's favourite actors.

The second line contains $ k $ distinct integers $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=m $ ) — the identifiers of Vasya's favourite actors.

The third line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ) — the number of movies in Vasya's list.

Then follow $ n $ blocks of lines, each block contains a movie's description. The $ i $ -th movie's description contains three lines:

- the first line contains string $ s_{i} $ ( $ s_{i} $ consists of lowercase English letters and can have the length of from $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ characters, inclusive) — the movie's title,

- the second line contains a non-negative integer $ d_{i} $ ( $ 1<=d_{i}<=m $ ) — the number of actors who starred in this movie,

- the third line has $ d_{i} $ integers $ b_{i,j} $ ( $ 0<=b_{i,j}<=m $ ) — the identifiers of the actors who star in this movie. If $ b_{i,j}=0 $ , than Vasya doesn't remember the identifier of the $ j $ -th actor. It is guaranteed that the list of actors for a movie doesn't contain the same actors.

All movies have distinct names. The numbers on the lines are separated by single spaces.

### 输出格式

Print $ n $ lines in the output. In the $ i $ -th line print:

- 0, if the $ i $ -th movie will surely be the favourite;

- 1, if the $ i $ -th movie won't surely be the favourite;

- 2, if the $ i $ -th movie can either be favourite, or not favourite.

## 说明

Note to the second sample:

- Movie jumanji can theoretically have from 1 to 3 Vasya's favourite actors.

- Movie theeagle has all three favourite actors, as the actor Vasya failed to remember, can only have identifier 5.

- Movie matrix can have exactly one favourite actor.

- Movie sourcecode doesn't have any favourite actors.

Thus, movie theeagle will surely be favourite, movies matrix and sourcecode won't surely be favourite, and movie jumanji can be either favourite (if it has all three favourite actors), or not favourite.
