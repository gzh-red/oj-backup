### 题目描述

有一棵以1为根的有根树，第i个节点的父亲为$f_i$，每个节点上有一个数为$a_i$。

共有m个事件：

P x y:若x是y的祖先，把$f_y$改为x，否则把$f_x$改为$f_y$

V x v:把$a_x$改为v

求初始和每个事件发生后随机两个点（可以是同一个点）的LCA的$a_i$的期望

### 输入格式

第一行有一个整数n

第二行有n-1个整数，第i个整数是$f_{i+1}$

第三行有n个整数，第i个整数是$a_i$

第四行有一个整数m

接下来m行每行有一个事件

### 输出格式

共m+1行，输出初始和每个事件发生后随机两个点（可以是同一个点）的LCA的$a_i$的期望

## 题目描述

You have a root tree containing $ n $ vertexes. Let's number the tree vertexes with integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . The tree root is in the vertex $ 1 $ .

Each vertex (except fot the tree root) $ v $ has a direct ancestor $ p_{v} $ . Also each vertex $ v $ has its integer value $ s_{v} $ .

Your task is to perform following queries:

- P $ v $ $ u $ ( $ u≠v $ ). If $ u $ isn't in subtree of $ v $ , you must perform the assignment $ p_{v}=u $ . Otherwise you must perform assignment $ p_{u}=v $ . Note that after this query the graph continues to be a tree consisting of $ n $ vertexes.

- V $ v $ $ t $ . Perform assignment $ s_{v}=t $ .

Your task is following. Before starting performing queries and after each query you have to calculate expected value written on the lowest common ancestor of two equiprobably selected vertices $ i $ and $ j $ . Here lowest common ancestor of $ i $ and $ j $ is the deepest vertex that lies on the both of the path from the root to vertex $ i $ and the path from the root to vertex $ j $ . Please note that the vertices $ i $ and $ j $ can be the same (in this case their lowest common ancestor coincides with them).

Print $ q+1 $ number — the corresponding expected values. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-9} $ .
