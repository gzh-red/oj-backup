# Jamie and To-do List

## 题意翻译

为什么我要完成这么多任务?

Jamie正忙于他的学校生活。他开始忘记他要做的任务。他决定把事情写在待办事项清单上。他为每个任务分配一个优先级(更低的值意味着更重要)，这样他就可以决定需要花更多的时间在上面。

过了几天，Jamie发现这个列表太大了，他甚至不能自己管理列表。当你是Jamie的好朋友时，帮他写一个计划来支持下面的任务:

设置一个a[i] x[i] -如果不存在，将任务列表添加到任务列表中，并将其优先级设置为x[i]。如果赋值a[i]已经在任务列表中，它的优先级将改为x[i]

删除a[i] -从待办事项列表中删除任务，如果它存在于任务列表中。

查询a[i] -输出的任务数量比分配a[i]更重要(优先级更小)，这样Jamie可以决定一个更好的调度。输出−1。如果a[i]不在待办事项列表中。

撤销d[i] -撤销之前d[i]天所做的所有更改(不包括该操作的当天)

在第0天，任务列表是空的。在接下来的每一个q天里，Jamie将会完成四项操作中的一项。如果操作是查询，那么你应该在进行到第二天之前输出查询的结果，否则可怜的Jamie无法做出适当的决策。

## 题目描述

Why I have to finish so many assignments???

Jamie is getting very busy with his school life. He starts to forget the assignments that he has to do. He decided to write the things down on a to-do list. He assigns a value priority for each of his assignment (lower value means more important) so he can decide which he needs to spend more time on.

After a few days, Jamie finds out the list is too large that he can't even manage the list by himself! As you are a good friend of Jamie, help him write a program to support the following operations on the to-do list:

- $ set\ a_{i}\ x_{i} $ — Add assignment $ a_{i} $ to the to-do list if it is not present, and set its priority to $ x_{i} $ . If assignment $ a_{i} $ is already in the to-do list, its priority is changed to $ x_{i} $ .

- $ remove\ a_{i} $ — Remove assignment $ a_{i} $ from the to-do list if it is present in it.

- $ query\ a_{i} $ — Output the number of assignments that are more important (have a smaller priority value) than assignment $ a_{i} $ , so Jamie can decide a better schedule. Output $ -1 $ if $ a_{i} $ is not in the to-do list.

- $ undo\ d_{i} $ — Undo all changes that have been made in the previous $ d_{i} $ days (not including the day of this operation)

At day $ 0 $ , the to-do list is empty. In each of the following $ q $ days, Jamie will do exactly one out of the four operations. If the operation is a $ query $ , you should output the result of the query before proceeding to the next day, or poor Jamie cannot make appropriate decisions.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line consists of a single integer $ q $ $ (1<=q<=10^{5}) $ — the number of operations.

The following $ q $ lines consists of the description of the operations. The $ i $ -th line consists of the operation that Jamie has done in the $ i $ -th day. The query has the following format:

The first word in the line indicates the type of operation. It must be one of the following four: set, remove, query, undo.

- If it is a set operation, a string $ a_{i} $ and an integer $ x_{i} $ follows $ (1<=x_{i}<=10^{9}) $ . $ a_{i} $ is the assignment that need to be set to priority $ x_{i} $ .

- If it is a remove operation, a string $ a_{i} $ follows. $ a_{i} $ is the assignment that need to be removed.

- If it is a query operation, a string $ a_{i} $ follows. $ a_{i} $ is the assignment that needs to be queried.

- If it is a undo operation, an integer $ d_{i} $ follows $ (0<=d_{i}<i) $ . $ d_{i} $ is the number of days that changes needed to be undone. All assignment names $ a_{i} $ only consists of lowercase English letters and have a length $ 1<=|a_{i}|<=15 $ . It is guaranteed that the last operation is a query operation.

### 输出格式

For each query operation, output a single integer — the number of assignments that have a priority lower than assignment $ a_{i} $ , or $ -1 $ if $ a_{i} $ is not in the to-do list.

Interaction

If the operation is a $ query $ , you should output the result of the query and flush the output stream before proceeding to the next operation. Otherwise, you may get the verdict Idleness Limit Exceed.

For flushing the output stream, please refer to the documentation of your chosen programming language. The flush functions of some common programming languages are listed below:

- C: fflush(stdout);

- C++: cout « flush;

- Java: System.out.flush();
