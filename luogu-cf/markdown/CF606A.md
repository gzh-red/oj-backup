# Magic Spheres

## 题目描述

Carl is a beginner magician. He has $ a $ blue, $ b $ violet and $ c $ orange magic spheres. In one move he can transform two spheres of the same color into one sphere of any other color. To make a spell that has never been seen before, he needs at least $ x $ blue, $ y $ violet and $ z $ orange spheres. Can he get them (possible, in multiple actions)?

## 说明

In the first sample the wizard has $ 4 $ blue and $ 4 $ violet spheres. In his first action he can turn two blue spheres into one violet one. After that he will have $ 2 $ blue and $ 5 $ violet spheres. Then he turns $ 4 $ violet spheres into $ 2 $ orange spheres and he ends up with $ 2 $ blue, $ 1 $ violet and $ 2 $ orange spheres, which is exactly what he needs.
