# 题目描述

有一天，Vasy被委托了一个非常重要的任务:在一个晚上写一个程序。该程序由n行代码组成。Vasya已经筋疲力尽了，所以他这样工作：首先他写v行代码，喝一杯茶，然后他写![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/be8d069d652d51f8329016702f7c81645767ac06.png)行代码，再喝一杯茶，然后他再写![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/4e3353b53aaa8dff17e86fc64d74d2d54f694513.png)v行......以此类推。

Vasya想知道，在睡着之前，允许他写出不少于n行代码的最小值v可以取多少。

## 题目描述

One day a highly important task was commissioned to Vasya — writing a program in a night. The program consists of $ n $ lines of code. Vasya is already exhausted, so he works like that: first he writes $ v $ lines of code, drinks a cup of tea, then he writes as much as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/be8d069d652d51f8329016702f7c81645767ac06.png) lines, drinks another cup of tea, then he writes ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/4e3353b53aaa8dff17e86fc64d74d2d54f694513.png) lines and so on: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/a5bacd91332aa3ca090a08cb4e8f844f5d3d784c.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/ede57aab14af8ddc634829ecddc32e347a436c9b.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/20a97db0948a36e5f09f82904c2091443493b97d.png), ...

The expression ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/ff48225f7f772c08409f2d464b02c44cf20620e2.png) is regarded as the integral part from dividing number $ a $ by number $ b $ .

The moment the current value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF165B/258034bacce7d114896705c6697a419f7cbd7ee3.png) equals 0, Vasya immediately falls asleep and he wakes up only in the morning, when the program should already be finished.

Vasya is wondering, what minimum allowable value $ v $ can take to let him write not less than $ n $ lines of code before he falls asleep.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of two integers $ n $ and $ k $ , separated by spaces — the size of the program in lines and the productivity reduction coefficient, $ 1<=n<=10^{9} $ , $ 2<=k<=10 $ .

### 输出格式

Print the only integer — the minimum value of $ v $ that lets Vasya write the program in one night.

## 说明

In the first sample the answer is $ v=4 $ . Vasya writes the code in the following portions: first $ 4 $ lines, then $ 2 $ , then $ 1 $ , and then Vasya falls asleep. Thus, he manages to write $ 4+2+1=7 $ lines in a night and complete the task.

In the second sample the answer is $ v=54 $ . Vasya writes the code in the following portions: $ 54 $ , $ 6 $ . The total sum is $ 54+6=60 $ , that's even more than $ n=59 $ .
