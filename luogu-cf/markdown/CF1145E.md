# Fourier Doodles

## 题意翻译

从$21$到$50$的每个$i$，输出：

`((min(k,25)+k)mod(2+k%3) > 0)? 1: 0`。

每个数占一行。

## 题目描述

In this problem you have to solve a simple classification task: given an image, determine whether it depicts a Fourier doodle.

You are given a set of 50 images with ids 1 through 50. You are also given a text file labels.txt containing the labels for images with ids 1 through 20, which comprise the learning data set.

You have to output the classification results for images with ids 21 through 50 in the same format.
