# Truncatable primes【卡语言已隐藏】

## 题目描述

A truncatable prime is a prime number which contains no zeros in decimal notation and all its suffixes are primes. 1 is considered to be not a prime.

You are given a positive integer $ n $ . Figure out whether it is a truncatable prime.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line of input contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{7} $ ).

### 输出格式

Output "YES" if $ n $ is a truncatable prime. Output "NO" otherwise. Quotes for clarity only.

## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
19

```
### 输出样例 #1

```cpp
NO

```
### 输入样例 #2

```cpp
9137

```
### 输出样例 #2

```cpp
YES

```
## 说明

In the first sample 19 is a prime but its suffix 9 is not.

In the second sample 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all primes, so 9137 is a truncatable prime.
