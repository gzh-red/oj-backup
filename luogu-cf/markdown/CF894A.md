# QAQ

## 题意翻译

题目大意： 给定一个字符串，字符串长度<=100，现在要求出字符串中'QAQ'的个数，注意，'QAQ'可以不连续，只要有顺序就可以了，例如QABQ也有一个QAQ

## 题目描述

"QAQ" is a word to denote an expression of crying. Imagine "Q" as eyes with tears and "A" as a mouth.

Now Diamond has given Bort a string consisting of only uppercase English letters of length $ n $ . There is a great number of "QAQ" in the string (Diamond is so cute!).

Note that the letters "QAQ" don't have to be consecutive, but the order of letters should be exact.
