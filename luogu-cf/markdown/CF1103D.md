# Professional layer

## 题意翻译

题意简述：给n个二元组和一个k。

二元组(ai,ei)表示第i个位置的权值是ai，贡献是ei。

现在对于每个位置可以让它的权值除以它自己一个不超过k的约数，要求从n个数中选择若干个数出来，使得它们的权值在除以约数过后的gcd为1，花费的代价是选出来的选择数的个数乘上选出来的所有数的贡献和。

数据范围：n≤1e5,k,ai≤1e12;

## 题目描述

Cardbluff is popular sport game in Telegram. Each Cardbluff player has ever dreamed about entrance in the professional layer. There are $ n $ judges now in the layer and you are trying to pass the entrance exam. You have a number $ k $ — your skill in Cardbluff.

Each judge has a number $ a_i $ — an indicator of uncertainty about your entrance to the professional layer and a number $ e_i $ — an experience playing Cardbluff. To pass the exam you need to convince all judges by playing with them. You can play only one game with each judge. As a result of a particular game, you can divide the uncertainty of $ i $ -th judge by any natural divisor of $ a_i $ which is at most $ k $ . If GCD of all indicators is equal to $ 1 $ , you will enter to the professional layer and become a judge.

Also, you want to minimize the total amount of spent time. So, if you play with $ x $ judges with total experience $ y $ you will spend $ x \cdot y $ seconds.

Print minimal time to enter to the professional layer or $ -1 $ if it's impossible.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There are two numbers in the first line $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^6 $ , $ 1 \leq k \leq 10^{12} $ ) — the number of judges and your skill in Cardbluff.

The second line contains $ n $ integers, where $ i $ -th number $ a_i $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12} $ ) — the uncertainty of $ i $ -th judge

The third line contains $ n $ integers in the same format ( $ 1 \leq e_i \leq 10^9 $ ), $ e_i $ — the experience of $ i $ -th judge.

### 输出格式

Print the single integer — minimal number of seconds to pass exam, or $ -1 $ if it's impossible
