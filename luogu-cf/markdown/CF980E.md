The nation has $ n $ districts numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , each district has exactly one path connecting it to every other district. The number of fans of a contestant from district $ i $ is equal to $ 2^i $ .

This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $ k $ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts.

The next $ n-1 $ lines each contains two integers $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ 1 \leq a, b \leq n $ , $ a \ne b $ ), that describe a road that connects two different districts $ a $ and $ b $ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.
