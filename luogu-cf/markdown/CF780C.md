## 题目描述

Andryusha goes through a park each day. The squares and paths between them look boring to Andryusha, so he decided to decorate them.

The park consists of $ n $ squares connected with $ (n-1) $ bidirectional paths in such a way that any square is reachable from any other using these paths. Andryusha decided to hang a colored balloon at each of the squares. The baloons' colors are described by positive integers, starting from $ 1 $ . In order to make the park varicolored, Andryusha wants to choose the colors in a special way. More precisely, he wants to use such colors that if $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ are distinct squares that $ a $ and $ b $ have a direct path between them, and $ b $ and $ c $ have a direct path between them, then balloon colors on these three squares are distinct.

Andryusha wants to use as little different colors as possible. Help him to choose the colors!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 3<=n<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of squares in the park.

Each of the next $ (n-1) $ lines contains two integers $ x $ and $ y $ ( $ 1<=x,y<=n $ ) — the indices of two squares directly connected by a path.

It is guaranteed that any square is reachable from any other using the paths.

### 输出格式

In the first line print single integer $ k $ — the minimum number of colors Andryusha has to use.

In the second line print $ n $ integers, the $ i $ -th of them should be equal to the balloon color on the $ i $ -th square. Each of these numbers should be within range from $ 1 $ to $ k $ .

## 说明

In the first sample the park consists of three squares: $ 1→3→2 $ . Thus, the balloon colors have to be distinct.

- $ 1→3→2 $

- $ 1→3→4 $

- $ 1→3→5 $

- $ 2→3→4 $

- $ 2→3→5 $

- $ 4→3→5 $

We can see that each pair of squares is encountered in some triple, so all colors have to be distinct. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF780C/33e7e26dd4a534cc2b3d2f68d2915498bf84dca9.png)Illustration for the second sample.In the third example there are following triples:

- $ 1→2→3 $

- $ 2→3→4 $

- $ 3→4→5 $

We can see that one or two colors is not enough, but there is an answer that uses three colors only. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF780C/739625cabfe2d695ed217961c7a844a8a3c127e6.png)Illustration for the third sample.
