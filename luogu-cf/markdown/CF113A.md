题目描述

Petya对语法感兴趣，他发明了他自己的语言。他想让他的语言尽量简单，只需要能够与朋友聊天就够了。所以，语法规则只有一下几条：

有三种词性：形容词、名词、动词。这个语言中每一个词都属于这三种词性。

有两种性别：阳性和阴性。每一个词要么是阳性，要么是阴性。

阳性形容词结尾是-lios，阴性形容词结尾是-liala。

阳性名词结尾是-etr，阴性名词结尾是-etra。

阳性动词结尾是-initis，阴性动词结尾是-inites。

所以，每一个单词只有上述6种结尾。没有其它的结尾。

只含有上述后缀的单词是允许的。也就是说，“lios”、 “liala”、“etr”等等也是正确的单词。

没有标点符号、时态、单复数以及其它复杂的东西。

一个句子或者是一个正确的单词，或者是一个陈述。

其中，“陈述”满足下面两点要求：

陈述中的单词应该按照下面的顺序（从左到右）：0个或多个形容词、一个名词、0个或多个动词。

所有的单词必须有同样的性别。

Petya需要你来帮助他检查语法。你的任务是确定他给你的一些单词是否是一个句子。

输入输出格式

输入格式：

第1行包括1个或多个小写字母组成的单词。总共的字符数（包括字母和空格）不超过10^5.

保证任意两个连续的词刚好由一个空格分开，且输入数据不在任何其他的地方含有空格。有可能给定的词不属于Petya的语言。

输出格式：

如果有一些词不属于Petya的语言，或者是输入中有大于1个句子，输出“NO”。否则（即输入的是一个正确的句子），输出“YES”。

## 题目描述

Petya got interested in grammar on his third year in school. He invented his own language called Petya's. Petya wanted to create a maximally simple language that would be enough to chat with friends, that's why all the language's grammar can be described with the following set of rules:

- There are three parts of speech: the adjective, the noun, the verb. Each word in his language is an adjective, noun or verb.

- There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Each word in his language has gender either masculine or feminine.

- Masculine adjectives end with -lios, and feminine adjectives end with -liala.

- Masculine nouns end with -etr, and feminime nouns end with -etra.

- Masculine verbs end with -initis, and feminime verbs end with -inites.

- Thus, each word in the Petya's language has one of the six endings, given above. There are no other endings in Petya's language.

- It is accepted that the whole word consists of an ending. That is, words "lios", "liala", "etr" and so on belong to the Petya's language.

- There aren't any punctuation marks, grammatical tenses, singular/plural forms or other language complications.

- A sentence is either exactly one valid language word or exactly one statement.

Statement is any sequence of the Petya's language, that satisfy both conditions:

- Words in statement follow in the following order (from the left to the right): zero or more adjectives followed by exactly one noun followed by zero or more verbs.

- All words in the statement should have the same gender.

After Petya's friend Vasya wrote instant messenger (an instant messaging program) that supported the Petya's language, Petya wanted to add spelling and grammar checking to the program. As Vasya was in the country and Petya didn't feel like waiting, he asked you to help him with this problem. Your task is to define by a given sequence of words, whether it is true that the given text represents exactly one sentence in Petya's language.

## 输入输出格式
