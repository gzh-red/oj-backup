# Table

## 题意翻译

John有一个n*m的矩阵，一共有k种颜色的染料，其中一些格子已经染了颜色。定义一条右下路径为从左上角到右下角每次只能走到当前格子下方相邻的格子或者右方相邻的格子，John现在要给剩下的格子染色，使得任意一条右下路径不会经过两个相同颜色的点。

输出染色的方法数 %1000000007

第一行三个整数n,m,k（1<=n,m<=1000 , 1<=k<=10）

接下来的n行是一个n*m的矩阵,若a[i][j]==0,那么表示这个格子未涂上颜色，否则表示这个格子涂上了第a[i][j]种颜色

一个整数，表示输出染色的方法数 %1000000007

## 题目描述

John Doe has an $ n×m $ table. John Doe can paint points in some table cells, not more than one point in one table cell. John Doe wants to use such operations to make each square subtable of size $ n×n $ have exactly $ k $ points.

John Doe wondered, how many distinct ways to fill the table with points are there, provided that the condition must hold. As this number can be rather large, John Doe asks to find its remainder after dividing by $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .

You should assume that John always paints a point exactly in the center of some cell. Two ways to fill a table are considered distinct, if there exists a table cell, that has a point in one way and doesn't have it in the other.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

A single line contains space-separated integers $ n $ , $ m $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n<=100; n<=m<=10^{18}; 0<=k<=n^{2} $ ) — the number of rows of the table, the number of columns of the table and the number of points each square must contain.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

### 输出格式

In a single line print a single integer — the remainder from dividing the described number of ways by $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .

## 说明

Let's consider the first test case:

So, if it has one point, then there shouldn't be points in any other place. If one of the white areas has a point, then the other one also must have a point. Thus, there are about $ 20 $ variants, where the point lies in the gray area and $ 25 $ variants, where each of the white areas contains a point. Overall there are $ 45 $ variants.
