# Mashmokh and ACM

## 题意翻译

如果一个数列中，后一个数都能被前面一个数整除，那么就叫这个数列为好数列。输入n，k，求数列中最大元素为n，数列长度为k的好数列的种数（对1000000007取模）

## 题目描述

Mashmokh's boss, Bimokh, didn't like Mashmokh. So he fired him. Mashmokh decided to go to university and participate in ACM instead of finding a new job. He wants to become a member of Bamokh's team. In order to join he was given some programming tasks and one week to solve them. Mashmokh is not a very experienced programmer. Actually he is not a programmer at all. So he wasn't able to solve them. That's why he asked you to help him with these tasks. One of these tasks is the following.

A sequence of $ l $ integers $ b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{l} $ $ (1<=b_{1}<=b_{2}<=...<=b_{l}<=n) $ is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF414B/c97c90bdd5f34b7b09ca5088db0c88621395bd9c.png) for all $ i $ $ (1<=i<=l-1) $ .

Given $ n $ and $ k $ find the number of good sequences of length $ k $ . As the answer can be rather large print it modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $ n,k (1<=n,k<=2000) $ .

### 输出格式

Output a single integer — the number of good sequences of length $ k $ modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .
