# LCM

## 题意翻译

给定一个正整数$b$ $(1\leq b \leq 10^{10})$。

把一个正整数$a$从$1$枚举到$10^{18}$，求有多少种不同的$\large \frac{[a,b]}{a}$。（$[a,b]$代表$a$与$b$的最小公倍数）

## 题目描述

Ivan has number $ b $ . He is sorting through the numbers $ a $ from $ 1 $ to $ 10^{18} $ , and for every $ a $ writes $ \frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a} $ on blackboard. Here $ [a, \,\, b] $ stands for least common multiple of $ a $ and $ b $ . Ivan is very lazy, that's why this task bored him soon. But he is interested in how many different numbers he would write on the board if he would finish the task. Help him to find the quantity of different numbers he would write on the board.

## 说明

In the first example $ [a, \,\, 1] = a $ , therefore $ \frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a} $ is always equal to $ 1 $ .

In the second example $ [a, \,\, 2] $ can be equal to $ a $ or $ 2 \cdot a $ depending on parity of $ a $ . $ \frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a} $ can be equal to $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ .
