# Sail

## 题目描述

The polar bears are going fishing. They plan to sail from $ (s_{x},s_{y}) $ to $ (e_{x},e_{y}) $ . However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows in one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is currently at $ (x,y) $ .

- If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to $ (x+1,y) $ .

- If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to $ (x,y-1) $ .

- If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to $ (x-1,y) $ .

- If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to $ (x,y+1) $ .

Alternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at $ (x,y) $ . Given the wind direction for $ t $ seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to $ (e_{x},e_{y}) $ ?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains five integers $ t,s_{x},s_{y},e_{x},e_{y} $ $ (1<=t<=10^{5},-10^{9}<=s_{x},s_{y},e_{x},e_{y}

The second line contains $ t $ characters, the $ i $ -th character is the wind blowing direction at the $ i $ -th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: "E" (east), "S" (south), "W" (west) and "N" (north).

### 输出格式

If they can reach $ (e_{x},e_{y}) $ within $ t $ seconds, print the earliest time they can achieve it. Otherwise, print "-1" (without quotes).

## 说明

In the first sample, they can stay at seconds $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , and move at seconds $ 2 $ , $ 4 $ .

In the second sample, they cannot sail to the destination.
