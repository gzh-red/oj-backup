## 说明

In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a $ 100 $ dollar bill, a $ 20 $ dollar bill, and a $ 5 $ dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive $ 125 $ dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two $ 20 $ dollar bills and three $ 1 $ dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw $ 100000000 $ (ten million!) $ 100 $ dollar bills.
