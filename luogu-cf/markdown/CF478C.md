# Table Decorations

## 题目描述

You have $ r $ red, $ g $ green and $ b $ blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number $ t $ of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values $ r $ , $ g $ and $ b $ will find the maximum number $ t $ of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The single line contains three integers $ r $ , $ g $ and $ b $ ( $ 0<=r,g,b<=2·10^{9} $ ) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer $ t $ — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.
