# Looking for Owls

## 题目描述

Emperor Palpatine loves owls very much. The emperor has some blueprints with the new Death Star, the blueprints contain $ n $ distinct segments and $ m $ distinct circles. We will consider the segments indexed from $ 1 $ to $ n $ in some way and the circles — indexed from $ 1 $ to $ m $ in some way.

Palpatine defines an owl as a set of a pair of distinct circles $ (i,j) $ ( $ i&lt;j $ ) and one segment $ k $ , such that:

1. circles $ i $ and $ j $ are symmetrical relatively to the straight line containing segment $ k $ ;

2. circles $ i $ and $ j $ don't have any common points;

3. circles $ i $ and $ j $ have the same radius;

4. segment $ k $ intersects the segment that connects the centers of circles $ i $ and $ j $ .

Help Palpatine, count the number of distinct owls on the picture.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers — $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=3·10^{5} $ , $ 2<=m<=1500 $ ).

The next $ n $ lines contain four integers each, $ x_{1} $ , $ y_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ y_{2} $ — the coordinates of the two endpoints of the segment. It's guaranteed that each segment has positive length.

The next $ m $ lines contain three integers each, $ x_{i} $ , $ y_{i} $ , $ r_{i} $ — the coordinates of the center and the radius of the $ i $ -th circle. All coordinates are integers of at most $ 10^{4} $ in their absolute value. The radius is a positive integer of at most $ 10^{4} $ .

It is guaranteed that all segments and all circles are dictinct.

### 输出格式

Print a single number — the answer to the problem.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to output 64-bit integers is С++. It is preferred to use the cout stream or the %I64d specifier.

## 说明

Here's an owl from the first sample. The owl is sitting and waiting for you to count it.
