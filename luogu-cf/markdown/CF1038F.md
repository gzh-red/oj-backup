# Wrap Around

## 题意翻译

给定一个字符串S，只包含'0'和'1'两个字符，求有多少长度为n的字符串T，满足以T为循环节的无限循环字符串包含S。

注意，哪怕在循环后相同，写出来不同的字符串T仍算不同的字符串T。例如10和01算不同的字符串T。

$|S| \leq n \leq 40$

## 题目描述

You are given a binary string $ s $ .

Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length $ n $ which contain $ s $ as a substring.

The cyclical string $ t $ contains $ s $ as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string $ t $ , such that $ s $ is a substring of this cyclical shift of $ t $ .

For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn't contain "0110" and "10110".

Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 40 $ ) — the length of the target string $ t $ .

The next line contains the string $ s $ ( $ 1 \le |s| \le n $ ) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $ t $ . String $ s $ contains only characters '0' and '1'.

### 输出格式

Print the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $ t $ , which contain $ s $ as a substring.

## 说明

In the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".

In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".
