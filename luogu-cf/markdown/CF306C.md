# White, Black and White Again

## 题意翻译

$Polycarpus$ 的生活总是满足“一些好事，然后一些坏事，然后一些好事”这样的规律。

所以 $Polycarpus$ 认为接下来的 $n$ 天也是满足这样的规律的。

$Polycarpus$ 知道，接下来会发生 $w$ 件两两不同的好事和 $b$ 件两两不同坏事，每天至少发生一件事，每天要么全部发生好事要么全部发生坏事。

由于 $Polycarpus$ 的规律，这 $n$ 天会先有若干天发生好事，再有若干天发生坏事，再有若干天发生好事(若干代指$>0$)。

要求统计事件发生的方案数（每天发生的事的顺序也不一样），答案取模 $10^9+9$ 输出。

## 题目描述

Polycarpus is sure that his life fits the description: "first there is a white stripe, then a black one, then a white one again". So, Polycarpus is sure that this rule is going to fulfill during the next $ n $ days. Polycarpus knows that he is in for $ w $ good events and $ b $ not-so-good events. At least one event is going to take place during each day. As each day is unequivocally characterizes as a part of a white or a black stripe, then each day is going to have events of the same type only (ether good or not-so-good).

What is the number of distinct ways this scenario can develop over the next $ n $ days if Polycarpus is in for a white stripe (a stripe that has good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day), the a black stripe (a stripe that has not-so-good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day) and a white stripe again (a stripe that has good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day). Each of $ n $ days will belong to one of the three stripes only.

Note that even the events of the same type are distinct from each other. Even if some events occur on the same day, they go in some order (there are no simultaneous events).

Write a code that prints the number of possible configurations to sort the events into days. See the samples for clarifications on which scenarios should be considered distinct. Print the answer modulo $ 1000000009 $ $ (10^{9}+9) $ .

## 说明

We'll represent the good events by numbers starting from 1 and the not-so-good events — by letters starting from 'a'. Vertical lines separate days.

In the first sample the possible ways are: "1|a|2" and "2|a|1". In the second sample the possible ways are: "1|a|b|2", "2|a|b|1", "1|b|a|2" and "2|b|a|1". In the third sample the possible ways are: "1|ab|2", "2|ab|1", "1|ba|2" and "2|ba|1".
