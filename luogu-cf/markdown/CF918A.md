## 题目描述

Eleven wants to choose a new name for herself. As a bunch of geeks, her friends suggested an algorithm to choose a name for her. Eleven wants her name to have exactly $ n $ characters.

More precisely, they suggested that the $ i $ -th letter of her name should be 'O' (uppercase) if $ i $ is a member of Fibonacci sequence, and 'o' (lowercase) otherwise. The letters in the name are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Fibonacci sequence is the sequence $ f $ where

- $ f_{1}=1 $ ,

- $ f_{2}=1 $ ,

- $ f_{n}=f_{n-2}+f_{n-1} $ ( $ n>2 $ ).

As her friends are too young to know what Fibonacci sequence is, they asked you to help Eleven determine her new name.
