# A Colourful Prospect

## 题意翻译

给定至多三个圆，求这些圆将平面划分为了几个区域

## 题目描述

Firecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement.

Little Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve.

A wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=3 $ ), denoting the number of circles.

The following $ n $ lines each contains three space-separated integers $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ ( $ -10<=x,y<=10 $ , $ 1<=r<=10 $ ), describing a circle whose center is $ (x,y) $ and the radius is $ r $ . No two circles have the same $ x $ , $ y $ and $ r $ at the same time.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the number of regions on the plane.
