## 题意翻译

你应该找到两个非负整数X和Y，表示瓦西亚可以买到X瓶可乐和Y瓶酒使得X·A + Y·B=n 或告诉它是不可能的。

输入格式： 第一行，一个整数n（1<=n<=10000000）表示瓦西亚有多少钱。 第二行，一个整数a (1<=a<=10000000) 表示每瓶可乐多少钱。 第三行, 一个整数b (1<=b<=10000000) 表示每瓶酒多少钱。

## 题目描述

Vasya has $ n $ burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs $ a $ burles and one Bars bar costs $ b $ burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly $ n $ burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers $ x $ and $ y $ such that Vasya can buy $ x $ bottles of Ber-Cola and $ y $ Bars bars and $ x·a+y·b=n $ or tell that it's impossible.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10000000 $ ) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer $ a $ ( $ 1<=a<=10000000 $ ) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer $ b $ ( $ 1<=b<=10000000 $ ) — cost of one Bars bar.

### 输出格式

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly $ n $ burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers $ x $ and $ y $ — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly $ n $ burles, i.e. $ x·a+y·b=n $ . If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers $ x $ and $ y $ can be equal $ 0 $ .

## 说明

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly $ 2·2+1·3=7 $ burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly $ n $ burles multiple ways:

- buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;

- buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;

- don't buy Ber-Cola and buy $ 10 $ Bars bars.

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly $ n $ burles.
