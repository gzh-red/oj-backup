# Duff in Mafia

## 题意翻译

给定一张图 点数为n，边数为m，每个边有颜色$c_i$,时间$t_i$,你要选出一些边，使得

1、这些边成为匹配(匹配的定义是没有两个边共用一个点)

2、剩余的边每种颜色也是一个匹配

3、删去的边$t_i$最大值最小

n<=5e4 m<=5e4 $c_i$,$t_i$<=1e9

输入:

第一行n,m

接下来m行

$u_i$,$v_i$,$c_i$,$t_i$

输出：第一行输出是否可行

第二行输出$t_i$最小值和你选出的边的个数

第三行输出你选出的边的编号

## 题目描述

Duff is one if the heads of Mafia in her country, Andarz Gu. Andarz Gu has $ n $ cities (numbered from 1 to $ n $ ) connected by $ m $ bidirectional roads (numbered by $ 1 $ to $ m $ ).

Each road has a destructing time, and a color. $ i $ -th road connects cities $ v_{i} $ and $ u_{i} $ and its color is $ c_{i} $ and its destructing time is $ t_{i} $ .

Mafia wants to destruct a matching in Andarz Gu. A matching is a subset of roads such that no two roads in this subset has common endpoint. They can destruct these roads in parallel, i. e. the total destruction time is a maximum over destruction times of all selected roads.

1. The remaining roads form a proper coloring.

2. Destructing time of this matching is minimized.

The remaining roads after destructing this matching form a proper coloring if and only if no two roads of the same color have same endpoint, or, in the other words, edges of each color should form a matching.

There is no programmer in Mafia. That's why Duff asked for your help. Please help her and determine which matching to destruct in order to satisfied those conditions (or state that this is not possible).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2<=n<=5×10^{4} $ and $ 1<=m<=5×10^{4} $ ), number of cities and number of roads in the country.

The next $ m $ lines contain the the roads. $ i-th $ of them contains four integers $ v_{i},u_{i},c_{i} $ and $ t_{i} $ ( $ 1<=v_{i},u_{i}<=n $ , $ v_{i}≠u_{i} $ and $ 1<=c_{i},t_{i}<=10^{9} $ for each $ 1<=i<=m $ ).

### 输出格式

In the first line of input, print "Yes" (without quotes) if satisfying the first condition is possible and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

If it is possible, then you have to print two integers $ t $ and $ k $ in the second line, the minimum destructing time and the number of roads in the matching (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF587D/465fbfd6bab02a6507061badb13bff93ada3fb77.png)).

In the third line print $ k $ distinct integers separated by spaces, indices of the roads in the matching in any order. Roads are numbered starting from one in order of their appearance in the input.

If there's more than one solution, print any of them.
