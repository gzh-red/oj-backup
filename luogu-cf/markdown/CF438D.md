## 题目描述

At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house up. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular the favorite sequence of Picks.

Fortunately, Picks remembers how to repair the sequence. Initially he should create an integer array $ a[1],a[2],...,a[n] $ . Then he should perform a sequence of $ m $ operations. An operation can be one of the following:

1. Print operation $ l,r $ . Picks should write down the value of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF438D/876beae330acc049f49836f16bfed34538663977.png).

2. Modulo operation $ l,r,x $ . Picks should perform assignment $ a[i]=a[i] mod x $ for each $ i $ $ (l<=i<=r) $ .

3. Set operation $ k,x $ . Picks should set the value of $ a[k] $ to $ x $ (in other words perform an assignment $ a[k]=x $ ).

Can you help Picks to perform the whole sequence of operations?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integer: $ n,m $ $ (1<=n,m<=10^{5}) $ . The second line contains $ n $ integers, separated by space: $ a[1],a[2],...,a[n] (1<=a[i]<=10^{9}) $ — initial value of array elements.

Each of the next $ m $ lines begins with a number $ type $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF438D/30ecae3e73b4644470ddff9dcee5b218291a621f.png).

- If $ type=1 $ , there will be two integers more in the line: $ l,r (1<=l<=r<=n) $ , which correspond the operation 1.

- If $ type=2 $ , there will be three integers more in the line: $ l,r,x (1<=l<=r<=n; 1<=x<=10^{9}) $ , which correspond the operation 2.

- If $ type=3 $ , there will be two integers more in the line: $ k,x (1<=k<=n; 1<=x<=10^{9}) $ , which correspond the operation 3.

### 输出格式

For each operation 1, please print a line containing the answer. Notice that the answer may exceed the 32-bit integer.
