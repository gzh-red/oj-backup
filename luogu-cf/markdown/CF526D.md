# Om Nom and Necklace

## 题意翻译

已知长度为n的字符串s，对于s的每一个前缀子串（即对于每一个i，s中从第1个字符到第i个的所有字符组成的字符串，1<=i<=n），如果满足ABABA...BA的形式（A、B可以为空，也可以是一个字符串，A有k+1个，B有k个），则请输出1，否则输出0，注意：n和k给定。

## 题目描述

One day Om Nom found a thread with $ n $ beads of different colors. He decided to cut the first several beads from this thread to make a bead necklace and present it to his girlfriend Om Nelly.

That's why he wants the beads on the necklace to form a regular pattern. A sequence of beads $ S $ is regular if it can be represented as $ S=A+B+A+B+A+...+A+B+A $ , where $ A $ and $ B $ are some bead sequences, " $ + $ " is the concatenation of sequences, there are exactly $ 2k+1 $ summands in this sum, among which there are $ k+1 $ " $ A $ " summands and $ k $ " $ B $ " summands that follow in alternating order. Om Nelly knows that her friend is an eager mathematician, so she doesn't mind if $ A $ or $ B $ is an empty sequence.

Help Om Nom determine in which ways he can cut off the first several beads from the found thread (at least one; probably, all) so that they form a regular pattern. When Om Nom cuts off the beads, he doesn't change their order.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=n,k<=1000000 $ ) — the number of beads on the thread that Om Nom found and number $ k $ from the definition of the regular sequence above.

The second line contains the sequence of $ n $ lowercase Latin letters that represent the colors of the beads. Each color corresponds to a single letter.

### 输出格式

Print a string consisting of $ n $ zeroes and ones. Position $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) must contain either number one if the first $ i $ beads on the thread form a regular sequence, or a zero otherwise.

## 说明

In the first sample test a regular sequence is both a sequence of the first 6 beads (we can take $ A= $ "", $ B= $ "bca"), and a sequence of the first 7 beads (we can take $ A= $ "b", $ B= $ "ca").

In the second sample test, for example, a sequence of the first 13 beads is regular, if we take $ A= $ "aba", $ B= $ "ba".
