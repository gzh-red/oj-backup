# Nicholas and Permutation

## 题意翻译

Nicholas有一个数组，里面有N个大小各不相同的数字

你可以让两个数的位置交换，让最大值和最小值的位置的差的绝对值最大

## 题目描述

Nicholas has an array $ a $ that contains $ n $ distinct integers from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . In other words, Nicholas has a permutation of size $ n $ .

Nicholas want the minimum element (integer $ 1 $ ) and the maximum element (integer $ n $ ) to be as far as possible from each other. He wants to perform exactly one swap in order to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements. The distance between two elements is considered to be equal to the absolute difference between their positions.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=100 $ ) — the size of the permutation.

The second line of the input contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ), where $ a_{i} $ is equal to the element at the $ i $ -th position.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.

## 说明

In the first sample, one may obtain the optimal answer by swapping elements $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ .

In the second sample, the minimum and the maximum elements will be located in the opposite ends of the array if we swap $ 7 $ and $ 2 $ .

In the third sample, the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements is already maximum possible, so we just perform some unnecessary swap, for example, one can swap $ 5 $ and $ 2 $ .
