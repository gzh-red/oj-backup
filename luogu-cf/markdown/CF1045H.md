# Self-exploration

## 题意翻译

求在$[l,r]$区间内有多少数满足在二进制下：

- 子串$00$的个数为$C00$。

- 子串$01$的个数为$C01$。

- 子串$10$的个数为$C10$。

- 子串$11$的个数为$C11$。

答案对$10^9+7$取模。

$\large l,r≤2^{100 \ 000}$

## 题目描述

Being bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of — binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in $ c_{00} $ , $ c_{01} $ , $ c_{10} $ and $ c_{11} $ , representing how many times substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 appear in the number respectively. For example:

$ 10111100 \rightarrow c_{00} = 1, \ c_{01} = 1,\ c_{10} = 2,\ c_{11} = 3 $

$ 10000 \rightarrow c_{00} = 3,\ c_{01} = 0,\ c_{10} = 1,\ c_{11} = 0 $

$ 10101001 \rightarrow c_{00} = 1,\ c_{01} = 3,\ c_{10} = 3,\ c_{11} = 0 $

$ 1 \rightarrow c_{00} = 0,\ c_{01} = 0,\ c_{10} = 0,\ c_{11} = 0 $

Wall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same $ c_{00} $ , $ c_{01} $ , $ c_{10} $ and $ c_{11} $ constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints $ c_{xy} $ given the interval $ [A, B] $ . Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo $ 10^9 + 7 $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First two lines contain two positive binary numbers $ A $ and $ B $ ( $ 1 \leq A \leq B < 2^{100\,000} $ ), representing the start and the end of the interval respectively. Binary numbers $ A $ and $ B $ have no leading zeroes.

Next four lines contain decimal numbers $ c_{00} $ , $ c_{01} $ , $ c_{10} $ and $ c_{11} $ ( $ 0 \leq c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11} \leq 100\,000 $ ) representing the count of two-digit substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 respectively.

### 输出格式

Output one integer number representing how many binary numbers in the interval $ [A, B] $ satisfy the constraints mod $ 10^9 + 7 $ .

## 说明

Example 1: The binary numbers in the interval $ [10,1001] $ are $ 10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001 $ . Only number 110 satisfies the constraints: $ c_{00} = 0, c_{01} = 0, c_{10} = 1, c_{11} = 1 $ .

Example 2: No number in the interval satisfies the constraints
