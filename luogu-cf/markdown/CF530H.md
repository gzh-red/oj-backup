# Points in triangle

## 题目描述

You are given a set of points on a plane with positive integer coordinates. Find a triangle of minimum area with vertices in points $ (0,0) $ , $ (A,0) $ and $ (0,B) $ ( $ A $ and $ B $ are unknown positive integers) that contains all the given points inside it (points on the edges count towards being inside).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains an integer $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=100 $ ) — the number of points. The following $ N $ lines contain pairs of numbers $ X $ and $ Y $ ( $ 1<=X,Y<=100 $ ) - the coordinates of the points. All points are distinct.

### 输出格式

Output one floating-point number — the minimal area of the triangle. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $ 10^{-4} $ .
