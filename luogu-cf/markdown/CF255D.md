# Mr. Bender and Square

## 题意翻译

给定一个n*n的正方形，给出（x，y）的点，每秒

可以向外扩散（x+1,y） (x-1,y) (x,y+1)

(x,y-1),求需要多少秒才能大于或等于面积C

## 题目描述

Mr. Bender has a digital table of size $ n×n $ , each cell can be switched on or off. He wants the field to have at least $ c $ switched on squares. When this condition is fulfilled, Mr Bender will be happy.

We'll consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1 to $ n $ , and the columns — numbered from left to right from 1 to $ n $ . Initially there is exactly one switched on cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ ( $ x $ is the row number, $ y $ is the column number), and all other cells are switched off. Then each second we switch on the cells that are off but have the side-adjacent cells that are on.

For a cell with coordinates $ (x,y) $ the side-adjacent cells are cells with coordinates $ (x-1,y) $ , $ (x+1,y) $ , $ (x,y-1) $ , $ (x,y+1) $ .

In how many seconds will Mr. Bender get happy?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

## 说明

Initially the first test has one painted cell, so the answer is 0. In the second test all events will go as is shown on the figure. ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF255D/b709c1aa5b91b7af907cf3f3ca10b895a1b76650.png).
