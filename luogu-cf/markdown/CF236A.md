# Boy or Girl

## 题意翻译

那些日子，许多男孩在论坛上使用漂亮女孩的照片作为化身。所以很难在第一眼就知道用户的性别。去年，我们的英雄去了一个论坛，和一位美女聊天（他想是这样）。之后，他们经常交谈，最终他们成为了网络中的一对情侣。

但是昨天，他在现实世界里看到了“她”，发现“她”其实是一个非常强壮的男人！我们的英雄很伤心，他太累了，不能再爱了。因此，他想出了一种通过用户名来识别用户性别的方法。

这是他的方法：如果用户名中的不同字符数是奇数，那么他是男性，否则她是女性。您给出了表示用户名的字符串，请用我们的方法帮助我们的英雄确定这个用户的性别。

## 题目描述

Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

### 输出格式

If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
wjmzbmr

```
### 输出样例 #1

```cpp
CHAT WITH HER!

```

CHAT WITH HER!

```
## 说明

For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".
