## 题目描述

The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. "Do I give such a hard task?" — the HR manager thought. "Just raise number $ 5 $ to the power of $ n $ and get last two digits of the number. Yes, of course, $ n $ can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not just follow the instructions."

Could you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?
