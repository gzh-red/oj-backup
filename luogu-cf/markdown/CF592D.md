# Super M

## 题意翻译

妖怪Ari不是一个普通的妖怪。她是Super M的隐藏身份， Byteforces的超级英雄。Byteforces是一个由n个城市n-1条双向道路组成的国家。每一条道路都连接两个不同的城市，并且整个道路系统一定可以从任意一个城市走到另一个城市。有m个城市被人类攻击了。所以Ari……我指的是Super M 必须立刻去所有被攻击的城市吓走人类。Super M只能经由给定的道路走。另外，每经过一条道路要花掉她1 kron——Byteforces使用的时间单位。

然而，Super M现在不在Byteforces。她正在一个邻近的国家——Codeforces参加一个训练营。幸运的是，有一种特殊设备能让她即刻瞬移到Byteforces的任何一个城市。由于回来的路太长了，所以瞬移只能使用一次。

请你通过计算出她在最开始应当瞬移到哪个城市使总时间最短（单位是kron）来帮助她，且告诉她可以实现的最短时间。

输入格式：

第一行两个整数n和m(1<=m<=n<=123456)。n表示Byteforces的城市数量，m表示被攻击的城市数量。

接下来的n-1行描述了道路系统。每一行两个整数ui和vi（1<=ui,vi<=n）表示这条道路连接的两个城市。

最后一行有m个整数，是被攻击的城市的编号。

输出格式：

第一行输出Super M应该瞬移到的城市。如果有多个合法，输出最小的那个。

接下来输出可实现的最短时间。

注：答案保证唯一。

## 题目描述

Ari the monster is not an ordinary monster. She is the hidden identity of Super M, the Byteforces’ superhero. Byteforces is a country that consists of $ n $ cities, connected by $ n-1 $ bidirectional roads. Every road connects exactly two distinct cities, and the whole road system is designed in a way that one is able to go from any city to any other city using only the given roads. There are $ m $ cities being attacked by humans. So Ari... we meant Super M have to immediately go to each of the cities being attacked to scare those bad humans. Super M can pass from one city to another only using the given roads. Moreover, passing through one road takes her exactly one kron - the time unit used in Byteforces.

Fortunately, there is a special device in Codeforces that allows her to instantly teleport from Codeforces to any city of Byteforces. The way back is too long, so for the purpose of this problem teleportation is used exactly once.

You are to help Super M, by calculating the city in which she should teleport at the beginning in order to end her job in the minimum time (measured in krons). Also, provide her with this time so she can plan her way back to Codeforces.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=n<=123456 $ ) - the number of cities in Byteforces, and the number of cities being attacked respectively.

Then follow $ n-1 $ lines, describing the road system. Each line contains two city numbers $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) - the ends of the road $ i $ .

The last line contains $ m $ distinct integers - numbers of cities being attacked. These numbers are given in no particular order.

### 输出格式

First print the number of the city Super M should teleport to. If there are many possible optimal answers, print the one with the lowest city number.

Then print the minimum possible time needed to scare all humans in cities being attacked, measured in Krons.

Note that the correct answer is always unique.

## 说明

In the first sample, there are two possibilities to finish the Super M's job in $ 3 $ krons. They are:

However, you should choose the first one as it starts in the city with the lower number.
