<h1>[USACO09HOL]假期绘画Holiday Painting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>To show their spirit for the holidays, the cows would like to paint a picture! Their picture will be represented as an R x C (1 <= R <= 50,000; 1 <= C <= 15) grid of unit squares, each of which is either 0 or 1. The grid rows are conveniently numbered 1..R; the columns are numbered 1..C.
Being pressed for time, the cows have asked their neighbors north of the border for help. Under the very helpful supervision of Canmuu the moose, they constructed a machine to throw paint at the picture in entire buckets! Beginning with all 0's in the picture grid, the machine splashes a certain paint color (either 0 or 1) over a
rectangle in the grid. In particular, Canmuu suggested that they perform Q (1 <= Q <= 10,000) operations; operation i consists of five integers R1\_i, R2\_i, C1\_i, C2\_i, and X\_i (1 <= R1\_i <= R2\_i <= R; 1 <= C1\_i <= C2\_i <= C; 0 <= X\_i <= 1), meaning that the cows will paint each unit square with a row index between R1\_i and R2\_i, inclusive, and a column index between C1\_i and C2\_i, inclusive, with color X\_i.
However, painting a picture like this is quite prone to mistakes. So Canmuu has enlisted you to determine, after each operation, the number of unit squares in the grid which are the correct color.

[USACO09HOL]假期绘画Holiday Painting
为了表达假日的激情，奶牛们要画一幅巨大的画.画布可以分成R\*C个方格，从上到下编为1到R行，从左到右编为1到C列.作画的颜色有两种，白色（用0）或者黑色（用1表）.
由于时间紧迫，奶牛们不得不请教北面的邻居，卡门.卡门送给她们一台机器，一次操作只输入5个参数R1\_i, R2\_i, C1\_i, C2\_i, and X\_i (1 <= R1\_i <= R2\_i <= R; 1 <= C1\_i <= C2\_i <= C; 0 <= X\_i <= 1),
把R1行到行R2，列C1到列C2的一个大长方形涂成色.在所有操作还未进行的时候，画 布是白色的.
奶牛们一共要进行Q次操作.因为这样的画法总要出些差错，所以奶牛们想 请你算算，每一次操作过后，一共有多少个方格与她们的目标画里对应的方格是同色的.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: R, C, and Q
\* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 contains C characters, each '0' or '1', denoting the i-th row of the grid in the obvious way.
\* Lines R+2..R+Q+1: Line R+i+1 contains five space-separated integers representing a paint operation: R1\_i, R2\_i, C1\_i, C2\_i, and X\_i
