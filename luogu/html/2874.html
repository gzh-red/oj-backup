<h1>[USACO07FEB]新牛棚Building A New Barn</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After scrimping and saving for years, Farmer John has decided to build a new barn. He wants the barn to be highly accessible, and he knows the coordinates of the grazing spots of all N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10,000 cows. Each grazing spot is at a point with integer coordinates (Xi, Yi) (-10,000 ≤ Xi ≤ 10,000; -10,000 ≤ Yi ≤ 10,000). The hungry cows never graze in spots that are horizontally or vertically adjacent.
The barn must be placed at integer coordinates and cannot be on any cow's grazing spot. The inconvenience of the barn for any cow is given the Manhattan distance formula | X - Xi | + | Y - Yi|, where (X, Y) and (Xi, Yi) are the coordinates of the barn and the cow's grazing spot, respectively. Where should the barn be constructed in order to minimize the sum of its inconvenience for all the cows?
给出平面上n个不相邻的点，要求到这n个点的曼哈顿距离之和最小的点的个数ans2，和这个最小距离ans1。

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Line 1: A single integer: N
Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers which are the grazing location (Xi, Yi) of cow i
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: the minimum inconvenience for the barn and the number of spots on which Farmer John can build the barn to achieve this minimum.
