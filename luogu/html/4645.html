<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个有向图，n个点，m条边。请问，1号点到2号点有多少条路径？如果有无限多条，输出inf，如果有限，输出答案模10^9的余数。
两点之间可能有重边，需要看成是不同的路径。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A bicycle race is being organized in a land far, far away. There are N town in the land, numbered 1 through N. There are also M one-way roads between the towns. The race will start in town 1 and end in town 2.
How many different ways can the route be set? Two routes are considered different if they do not use the exact same roads.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100 000), the number of towns and roads.
Each of the next M lines contains two different integers A and B, representing a road between towns A and B.
Towns may be connected by more than one road.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the number of distinct routes that can be set on a single line. If that number has more than nine digits, output only the last nine digits of the number. If there are infinitely many routes, output "inf".</div>
