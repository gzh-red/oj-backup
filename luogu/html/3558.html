<h1>[POI2013]BAJ-Bytecomputer</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给一个只包含-1,0,1的数列，每次操作可以让a[i]+=a[i-1]，求最少操作次数使得序列单调不降
数据范围为N<=10^6
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A sequence of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.1.png) integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.2.png) from the set ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.3.png) is given.
The bytecomputer is a device that allows the following operation on the sequence:
incrementing ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.4.png) by ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.5.png) for any ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.6.png).
There is no limit on the range of integers the bytecomputer can store, i.e., each ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.7.png) can (in principle) have arbitrarily small or large value.
Program the bytecomputer so that it transforms the input sequence into a non-decreasing sequence (i.e., such that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.8.png)) with the minimum number of operations.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the standard input holds a single integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.9.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.10.png)), the number of elements in the (bytecomputer's) input sequence.
The second line contains ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.11.png) integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.12.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.13.png)) that are the successive elements of the (bytecomputer's) input sequence, separated by single spaces.
In tests worth 24% of the total points it holds that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.14.png), and in tests worth 48% of the total points it holds that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.15.png).
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of the standard output should give one integer, the minimum number of operations the bytecomputer has to perform to make its input sequence non-decreasing, of the single word BRAK (Polish for none) if obtaining such a sequence is impossible.
