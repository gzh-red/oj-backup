<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在数轴上有 $N$ 头牛，第 $i$ 头牛位于 $x_i\:(0\le x_i\le 10^9)$ 。没有两头牛位于同一位置。
有两种牛：白牛和花斑牛。保证至少有一头白牛。你可以把白牛涂成花斑牛，不限数量，不限哪只。
找一段尽量长的区间，使得区间的两端点均有一头牛，且区间中白牛与花斑牛的数量相等。试求区间长度。
感谢 @Planet6174 的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>FJ's N cows (2 <= N <= 100,000) are standing at various positions along a long one-dimensional fence. The ith cow is standing at position x\_i (an integer in the range 0...1,000,000,000) and is either a plain white cow or a spotted cow. No two cows occupy the same position, and there is at least one white cow.
FJ wants to take a photo of a contiguous interval of cows for the county fair, but in fairness to his different cows, he wants to ensure there are equal numbers of white and spotted cows in the photo. FJ wants to determine the maximum size of such a fair photo, where the size of a photo is the difference between the maximum and minimum positions of the cows in the photo.
To give himself an even better chance of taking a larger photo, FJ has with him a bucket of paint that he can use to paint spots on an arbitrary subset of his white cows of his choosing, effectively turning them into spotted cows. Please determine the largest size of a fair photo FJ can take, given that FJ has the option of painting some of his white cows (of course, he does not need to paint any of the white cows if he decides this is better).

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>There are 5 cows. One of them is a white cow at position 8, and so on.
FJ takes a photo of the cows from positions 3 to positions 10. There are 4 cows in this range -- 3 white and 1 spotted -- so he needs to paint one of the white cows to make it spotted.
