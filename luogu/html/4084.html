<h1>[USACO17DEC]Barn Painting</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：给定一颗N个节点组成的树，3种颜色，其中K个节点已染色，要求任意两相邻节点颜色不同，求合法染色方案数。
翻译贡献者：Il_ItzABC_lI</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John has a large farm with $N$ barns ($1 \le N \le 10^5$), some of which are already painted and some not yet painted. Farmer John wants to paint these remaining barns so that all the barns are painted, but he only has three paint colors available. Moreover, his prize cow Bessie becomes confused if two barns that are directly reachable from one another are the same color, so he wants to make sure this situation does not happen.
It is guaranteed that the connections between the $N$ barns do not form any 'cycles'. That is, between any two barns, there is at most one sequence of connections that will lead from one to the other.
How many ways can Farmer John paint the remaining yet-uncolored barns?
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ ($0 \le K \le N$), respectively the number of barns on the farm and the number of barns that have already been painted.
The next $N-1$ lines each contain two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le N, x \neq y$) describing a path directly connecting barns $x$ and $y$.
The next $K$ lines each contain two integers $b$ and $c$ ($1 \le b \le N$, $1 \le c \le 3$) indicating that barn $b$ is painted with color $c$.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Compute the number of valid ways to paint the remaining barns, modulo $10^9 + 7$, such that no two barns which are directly connected are the same color.
