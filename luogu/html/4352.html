<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>$\quad$你从计算机科学转向农业，并且你的新工作涉及向日葵在地下温室的生长，温室中包括$n$朵向日葵，这些向日葵被排成一排，并且从左到右编号分别为$1...n$。有两盏灯来提供向日葵生长所需要的光和热：$A$灯在一排的最左端，而$B$灯在一排的最右端。
$\quad$每一天都一定会有一个灯开着，并使向日葵转向灯光，而且有几个向日葵会因此而成长。向日葵仅仅当它前面的（朝向灯的方向）向日葵比它高时它才会成长，而且成长时是匀速的，每一天都会成长$1\ cm$，注意，当一个向日葵开始成长时，它还可能使得在它后面的向日葵瞬间成长。
$\quad$给你每株向日葵的高度，还有每天开灯的时间表，要求求出最后所有的向日葵的高度。
**输入格式：**
$\quad$第一行包含两个整数$n,m(1\le n,m\le 300000)$，表示向日葵的数目和天数，下一行包含$n$个整数$h_1,h_2,h_3...h_n(1\le h_k\le 10^9)$，从左到右表示每株向日葵的高度
$\quad$接着下一行包含一个字符串，字符串中有$m$个字符$A\ or\ B$，第$i$个字符表示第$i$天是开那一个灯$(A\ or\ B)$
**输出格式：**
$\quad$输出一行包含$n$个整数，表示每一个向日葵最终的高度

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are switching from computer science to agriculture and your new job involves growing sunﬂowers in an underground greenhouse. The greenhouse contains n sunﬂower plants arranged in a straight line and numbered with integers 1 through n, from left to right. Two lamps provide the light and heat the sunﬂowers need to grow: the lamp A is positioned at the left end, while the lamp B is positioned at the right end of the line.
Every day exactly one of the lamps is on, causing all of the sunﬂowers to turn towards the light and some of them to grow. The sunﬂower will grow if and only if the sunﬂower directly in front of it (towards the light) is higher. The growth is continuous with a uniform rate of exactly 1 centimeter per day. Notice that, when a sunﬂower starts to grow, it may cause the sunﬂower directly behind it to start to grow instantaneously.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/pic/16238.png )
You are given initial heights of the sunﬂowers and the lamp schedule for the following m day period, ﬁnd the ﬁnal heights of all the sunﬂowers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The ﬁrst line contains two integers n and m (1≤n, m≤300000) – the number of sunﬂowers and the number of days in the period. The following line contains n integers h1,h2,...,hn (1≤ hk ≤$10^9$) – the initial heights (in centimeters) of the sunﬂowers, from left to right.
The following line contains a string consisting of exactly m characters A or B – the lamp schedule starting from the ﬁrst day of the period.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single line containing n integers – the ﬁnal heights of the sunﬂowers, from left to right.
