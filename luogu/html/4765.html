<h1>[CERC2014]The Imp</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你用一些辛苦赚来的黄金来到魔术商店，去购买奇妙而独特的魔法物品。商店里有这样的物品，每一个都锁在一个特殊的魔术箱里。我的TI thi盒的成本CICI ICI黄金碎片购买，并包含一个项目价值ViViVi黄金碎片。成本和项目价值是众所周知的，正如你以前阅读、掌握和记忆Yelod魔术目录一样。
一个凡人，比如你，可以安全地携带一个魔法物品。因此，你的目标是得到最珍贵的。如果你不是一个邪恶的魔法生物，你就会得到它。
小鬼可以施放恶作剧的咒语，它将任何魔法盒子的内容转化成毫无价值的尘埃。当然，他会在你买一个盒子后使用这个咒语，让你为这个物品付钱，而不是得到它。你被迫购买另一个盒子，然后是下一个盒子…
小鬼有足够的魔力在大多数KKK时间施放魔法。当然，他可以避免使用它，让你保留一个项目。你可以随时走开，两手空空（虽然肯定是耻辱）。然而，如果你得到一个项目，你必须保持它离开商店。
你的目标是使你的收益最大化（所获得的项目减去以前支付的所有费用），而IMP则希望最小化它。如果你和生物都使用最佳策略，你会赚多少黄金？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You arrive in Ye Olde Magic Shoppe with some hard-earned gold to purchase wondrous and unique magic items. There are $n$ such items in the shop, each of them locked in a special magic box. The $i-th$ box costs $c_i$ gold pieces to buy, and contains an item worth $v_i$ gold pieces. The costs and item values are known to you, as you have previously read, mastered, and memorized Ye Olde Magic Catalogue.
A mortal, such as you, can safely carry only one magic item. You therefore aim to get the most precious one. And obtain it you would, if not for a malicious, magical creature, known as The Imp.
The Imp can cast a mischievous spell, which transforms the content of any magic box into worthless dust. Of course, he will use the spell just after you buy a box, to make you pay for the item and not get it. You are thus forced to buy another box, and then the next one...
The Imp has enough magic to cast the spell at most $k$ times. He can, of course, refrain from using it, allowing you to keep an item. You can walk away at any time, empty-handed (though it would surely be a disgrace). However, if you get an item, you must keep it and leave the shop.
You aim to maximize your gain (the value of the acquired item minus all the expenses paid previously), while The Imp wants to minimize it. If both you and the creature use the optimal strategy, how much gold will you earn?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number of test cases $T$. The descriptions of
the test cases follow:
Each test case starts with a line containing the number of items $n(1 \le n \le 150 000)$ and the the maximum number of The Imp’s spells $k(0 \le k \le 9)$.
The next $n$ lines contain the items’values and costs, the $i-th$ line containing the numbers $v_i$ and $c_i$, in that order $(0 \le v_i, c_i \le 10^6)$.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line containing your gain.</div>
