<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a histogram consisting of N columns of heights $X_1$
, $X_2$
, … $X_N$
, respectively. The
histogram needs to be transformed into a roof using a series of operations. A roof is a
histogram that has the following properties:
- A single column is called the top of the roof. Let it be the column at position i.
- The height of the column at position j (1 ≤ j ≤ N) is $ h_j = h_i- |i - j|$.
- All heights $h_j$ are positive integers.
An operation can be increasing or decreasing the heights of a column of the histogram by 1.
It is your task to determine the minimal number of operations needed in order to transform
the given histogram into a roof.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ $10^5$
), the number of columns in the
histogram.
The following line contains N numbers $X_i$
(1 ≤ $X_i$ ≤ $10^9$
), the initial column heights.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You must output the minimal number of operations from the task.

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In test cases worth 60% of total points, it will hold N ≤ 5000.
**Clarification of the first test case:** ​By increasing the height of the second, third, and fourth column,
we created a roof where the fourth column is the top of the roof.
**Clarification of the second test case:** ​By decreasing the height of the third column three times, and
increasing the height of the fourth column, we transformed the histogram into a roof. The example is
illustrated below.
