<h1>[USACO07NOV]牛继电器Cow Relays</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For their physical fitness program, N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000) cows have decided to run a relay race using the T (2 ≤ T ≤ 100) cow trails throughout the pasture.
Each trail connects two different intersections (1 ≤ I1i ≤ 1,000; 1 ≤ I2i ≤ 1,000), each of which is the termination for at least two trails. The cows know the lengthi of each trail (1 ≤ lengthi  ≤ 1,000), the two intersections the trail connects, and they know that no two intersections are directly connected by two different trails. The trails form a structure known mathematically as a graph.
To run the relay, the N cows position themselves at various intersections (some intersections might have more than one cow). They must position themselves properly so that they can hand off the baton cow-by-cow and end up at the proper finishing place.
Write a program to help position the cows. Find the shortest path that connects the starting intersection (S) and the ending intersection (E) and traverses exactly N cow trails.
给出一张无向连通图，求S到E经过k条边的最短路。

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: N, T, S, and E
\* Lines 2..T+1: Line i+1 describes trail i with three space-separated integers: lengthi , I1i , and I2i
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: A single integer that is the shortest distance from intersection S to intersection E that traverses exactly N cow trails.
