<h1>[USACO07DEC]手链Charm Bracelet</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie has gone to the mall's jewelry store and spies a charm bracelet. Of course, she'd like to fill it with the best charms possible from the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 3,402) available charms. Each charm i in the supplied list has a weight Wi (1 ≤ Wi ≤ 400), a 'desirability' factor Di (1 ≤ Di ≤ 100), and can be used at most once. Bessie can only support a charm bracelet whose weight is no more than M (1 ≤ M ≤ 12,880).
Given that weight limit as a constraint and a list of the charms with their weights and desirability rating, deduce the maximum possible sum of ratings.
有N件物品和一个容量为V的背包。第i件物品的重量是c[i]，价值是w[i]。求解将哪些物品装入背包可使这些物品的重量总和不超过背包容量，且价值总和最大。
