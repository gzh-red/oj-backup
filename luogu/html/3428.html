<h1>[POI2005]AKC-Special Forces Manoeuvres</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Secretly Organized Tactical Infantry Exercises (SORTIE) take place in the Bledowska Desert. The main part of the SORTIE shall be the disarmament of a bomb, hidden in an unknown location in the desert.
The first part of the manoeuvres is an airborne operation. The commandos jump individually, in a predetermined order, from a helicopter hovering above the desert. Upon landing, each commando digs in and moves no further. Only then does the next commando proceed.
There is a survival radius defined for each commando. If the distance between the commando and the bomb is equal to (or smaller then) the survival radius, the commando will perish should the bomb go off. The command wants to minimize the number of soldiers taking part in the operation, but it wants to be sure that at least one of them survives the possible explosion.
We shall assume for our purposes that the Bledowska Desert is a plain and we shall identify the positions of the dug in commandos with points on this plane. We are given a sequence of commandos to jump. None of them may miss his turn, i.e. if the i-th commando jumps from the helicopter, than all those before him have already jumped. For each of the commandos we know his survival radius and the coordinates of the point he is going to land in, should he be required to jump.
TaskWrite a programme which:
reads from the standard input a description of each commando,calculates the minimal number of commandos to jump,writes the outcome to the standard output.
在一次军事行动中有一批空降兵要降落在沙漠中拆除炸弹. 空降兵按照预定的顺序跳伞并降落到指定的位置.一旦降落他们便呆在原地不动了. 每个空降兵都有一个生存半径. 如果炸弹与他的距离小于或等于这个生存半径的话,空降兵便会引爆炸弹导致死亡. 指挥官想尽量少的派出升降兵.但是在这个目标的前提是至少要能有1名伞兵活着回来.(无论炸弹在何处的情况下都如此). 我们可以假定沙漠抽象成一个二维平面,每个伞兵降落的地点都是这个平面上的一个整点.我

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer $n$ ($2\le n\le 2\ 000$) - the number of commandos. The following $n$ lines contain descriptions of commandos - one per line. The description of each commando is comprised of three integers: $x$, $y$ and $r$ ($-1\ 000\le x,y\le 1\ 000$, $1\le r\le 5\ 000$). The point $(x,y)$ denotes the landing place of the commando, and $r$ denotes his survival radius. If the commando finds himself within the survival radius $r$ from the bomb, he will perish should the bomb go off.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only line of the standard output your programme should write a single integer - the minimal number of commandos required to jump in order to secure the survival of at least one of them, or a single word NIE (i.e. no in Polish) if it is not possible to have an unconditional certainty that one of the commandos survives.
