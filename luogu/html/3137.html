<h1>[USACO16FEB]圆形谷仓Circular Barn_Silver</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built a new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn consists of a ring of $n$ rooms, numbered clockwise from $1 \ldots n$ around the perimeter of the barn ($3 \leq n \leq 1000$). Each room has doors to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to the exterior of the barn.
Farmer John owns $n$ cows, and he wants exactly one cow to end up in each room in the barn. However, the cows, being slightly confused, line up at haphazard doors, with possibly multiple cows lining up at the same door. Precisely $c_i$ cows line up outside the door to room $i$, so $\sum c_i = n$.
To manage the process of herding the cows so that one cow ends up in each room, Farmer John wants to use the following approach: each cow enters at the door at which she initially lined up, then walks clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable destination. Given that a cow walking through $d$ doors
consumes $d^2$ energy, please determine the minimum amount of energy needed to distribute the cows so one ends up in each room.
有一个 $N$ 个点的环，相邻两个点距离是 $1$ 。
点顺时针标号为 $1$ ~ $N$ 。
每一个点有$C_i$头牛，保证 $\sum ci=N$ 。
每头牛都可以顺时针走。设一头牛走了 $d$ 个单位停下了，将耗费 $d^2$ 的能量。
请设计一种牛的走法，使得每一个点上都正好有一头牛，且最小化耗费的能量。</div>
