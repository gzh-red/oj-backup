<h1>[USACO06JAN]把牛Corral the Cows</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John wishes to build a corral for his cows. Being finicky beasts, they demand that the corral be square and that the corral contain at least C (1 <= C <= 500) clover fields for afternoon treats. The corral's edges must be parallel to the X,Y axes.
FJ's land contains a total of N (C <= N <= 500) clover fields, each a block of size 1 x 1 and located at with its lower left corner at integer X and Y coordinates each in the range 1..10,000. Sometimes more than one clover field grows at the same location; such a field would have its location appear twice (or more) in the input. A corral surrounds a clover field if the field is entirely located inside the corral's borders.
Help FJ by telling him the side length of the smallest square containing C clover fields.
约翰打算建一个围栏来圈养他的奶牛.作为最挑剔的兽类，奶牛们要求这个围栏必须是正方 形的，而且围栏里至少要有C< 500)个草场，来供应她们的午餐.
约翰的土地上共有C<=N<=500)个草场，每个草场在一块1x1的方格内，而且这个方格的 坐标不会超过10000.有时候，会有多个草场在同一个方格内，那他们的坐标就会相同.
告诉约翰，最小的围栏的边长是多少？
