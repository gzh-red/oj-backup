<h1>[USACO13MAR]项链Necklace</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie the cow has arranged a string of N rocks, each containing a single letter of the alphabet, that she wants to build into a fashionable necklace.
Being protective of her belongings, Bessie does not want to share her necklace with the other cow currently living on her side of the barn. The other cow has a name that is a string of M characters, and Bessie wants to be sure that this length-M string does not occur as a contiguous substring anywhere within the string representing her necklace (otherwise, the other cow might mistakenly think the necklace is for her). Bessie decides to remove some of the rocks in her necklace so that the other cow's name does not appear as a substring. Please help Bessie determine the minimum number of rocks she must remove.
贝西收集了N颗石头，每颗石头上都有一个字母，贝西想把这些石头做成项链。
贝西的身边有另一只奶牛，这只奶牛的名字是一个长度为M的字符串，贝西不希望这只牛的名字出现在她的项链上(项链的子串)，她想知道，最少删掉几颗石头就可以避免这种情况发生。
