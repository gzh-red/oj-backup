<h1>[USACO15OPEN]被困在haybales</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>**题目简述: **
农夫约翰的干草堆排成一行，然后每个干草堆$j$有一个坐标$p[j]$和大小$s[j]$，
奶牛bessie在一个坐标$b$，被困在某两个干草堆之间，她可以在路上自由移动（向左or右），但她不可以穿过干草堆，
除非她朝同一个方向跑了$d$个单位的距离那么，她就可以击碎一个大小$s[j]< d $的干草堆。
但是FJ为了不让bessie跑到最左边或最右边的干草堆，
他打算给某一堆干草堆增大size，如果这样做可以达到目的，输出最少需要增大多少，否则输出$-1$
** I/0格式：**
第一行输入两个整数$n$和$b$,
然后分$n$行输入，每行输入两个整数$s[i]$和$p[i]$
输出$-1$或者增加多少
感谢@tony1312 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John has received a shipment of $N$ large hay bales
($1 \le N \le 100,000$), and placed them at various locations along the road
connecting the barn with his house. Each bale $j$ has a size $S_j$ and a
distinct position $P_j$ giving its location along the one-dimensional road.
Bessie the cow is currently located at position $B$, where there is no hay bale.
Bessie the cow can move around freely along the road, even up to the position at
which a bale is located, but she cannot cross through this position. As an
exception, if she runs in the same direction for $D$ units of distance, she
builds up enough speed to break through and permanently eliminate any hay bale
of size strictly less than $D$. Of course, after doing this, she might
open up more space to allow her to make a run at other hay bales, eliminating
them as well.
FJ is currently re-painting his house and his barn, and wants to make sure
Bessie cannot reach either one (cows and fresh paint do not make a good
combination!) Accordingly, FJ wants to make sure Bessie never breaks through
the leftmost or rightmost hay bale, so she stays effectively trapped within the
hay bales. FJ has the ability to add hay to a single bale of his choosing to
help keep Bessie trapped. Please help him determine the minimum amount of extra
size he needs to add to some bale to ensure Bessie stays trapped.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains $N$ as well as Bessie's initial position $B$.
Each of the next $N$ lines describes a bale, and contains two integers giving
its size and position. All sizes and positions are in the range $1\ldots 10^9$.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer, giving the minimum amount of hay FJ needs to add to
prevent Bessie from escaping. Print -1 if it is impossible to prevent Bessie's
escape.
</div>
