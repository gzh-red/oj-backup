<h1>[USACO08OCT]牧场散步Pasture Walking</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The N cows (2 <= N <= 1,000) conveniently numbered 1..N are grazing among the N pastures also conveniently numbered 1..N. Most conveniently of all, cow i is grazing in pasture i.
Some pairs of pastures are connected by one of N-1 bidirectional walkways that the cows can traverse. Walkway i connects pastures A\_i and B\_i (1 <= A\_i <= N; 1 <= B\_i <= N) and has a length of L\_i (1 <= L\_i <= 10,000).
The walkways are set up in such a way that between any two distinct pastures, there is exactly one path of walkways that travels between them. Thus, the walkways form a tree.
The cows are very social and wish to visit each other often. Ever in a hurry, they want you to help them schedule their visits by computing the lengths of the paths between 1 <= L\_i <= 10,000 pairs of pastures (each pair given as a query p1,p2 (1 <= p1 <= N; 1 <= p2 <= N).
POINTS: 200
有N(2<=N<=1000)头奶牛，编号为1到W，它们正在同样编号为1到N的牧场上行走.为了方 便，我们假设编号为i的牛恰好在第i号牧场上.
有一些牧场间每两个牧场用一条双向道路相连，道路总共有N - 1条，奶牛可以在这些道路 上行走.第i条道路把第Ai个牧场和第Bi个牧场连了起来(1 <= A\_i <= N; 1 <= B\_i <= N)，而它的长度 是 1 <= L\_i <= 10,000.在任意两个牧场间，有且仅有一条由若干道路组成的路径相连.也就是说，所有的道路构成了一棵树.
奶牛们十分希望经常互相见面.它们十分着急，所以希望你帮助它们计划它们的行程，你只 需要计算出Q(1 < Q < 1000)对点之间的路径长度•每对点以一个询问p1,p2 (1 <= p1 <= N; 1 <= p2 <= N). 的形式给出.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and Q
\* Lines 2..N: Line i+1 contains three space-separated integers: A\_i, B\_i, and L\_i
\* Lines N+1..N+Q: Each line contains two space-separated integers representing two distinct pastures between which the cows wish to travel: p1 and p2
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Lines 1..Q: Line i contains the length of the path between the two pastures in query i.
