<h1>[USACO16FEB]负载平衡Load Balancing_Silver</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John's $N$ cows are each standing at distinct locations $(x_1, y_1) \ldots (x_n, y_n)$ on his two-dimensional farm ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$, and the $x_i$'s and $y_i$'s are positive odd integers of size at most $1,000,000$). FJ wants to partition his field by building a long (effectively infinite-length) north-south fence with equation $x=a$ ($a$ will be an even integer, thus ensuring that he does not build the fence through the position of any cow). He also wants to build a long (effectively infinite-length) east-west fence with equation $y=b$, where $b$ is an even integer. These two fences cross at the point $(a,b)$, and together they partition his field into four regions.
FJ wants to choose $a$ and $b$ so that the cows appearing in the four resulting regions are reasonably "balanced", with no region containing too many cows. Letting $M$ be the maximum number of cows appearing in one of the four regions, FJ wants to make $M$ as small as possible. Please help him determine this
smallest possible value for $M$.
给你一个矩阵，里面有些点，让你横向切一刀，纵向切一刀，使得得到的四个区域内的最大的点数最少。

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a single integer, $N$. The next $N$ lines
each contain the location of a single cow, specifying its $x$ and $y$
coordinates.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You should output the smallest possible value of $M$ that FJ can achieve by
positioning his fences optimally.
