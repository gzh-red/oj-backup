<div>到冬天了，这意味着下雪了！从农舍到牛棚的路上有$N$块地砖，方便起见编号为$1 \dots N$，第$i$块地砖上积了$f_i$英尺的雪。
在Farmer John的农舍的地窖中，总共有$B$双靴子，编号为$1 \dots B$。其中某些比另一些结实，某些比另一些轻便。具体地说，第$i$双靴子能够让FJ在至多$s_i$英尺深的积雪中行走，能够让FJ每步至多前进$d_i$。
Farmer John从$1$号地砖出发，他必须到达$N$号地砖才能叫醒奶牛们。$1$号地砖在农舍的屋檐下，$N$号地砖在牛棚的屋檐下，所以这两块地砖都没有积雪。帮助Farmer John求出哪些靴子可以帮助他走完这段艰辛的路程。
输入格式（文件名：snowboots.in）：
第一行包含两个空格分隔的整数$N$和$B$（$1 \leq N,B \leq 10^5$）。
第二行包含$N$个空格分隔的整数；第$i$个整数为$f_i$，即$i$号地砖的积雪深度（$0 \leq f_i \leq 10^9$）。输入保证$f_1 = f_N = 0$。
下面$B$行，每行包含两个空格分隔的整数。第$i+2$行的第一个数为$s_i$，表示第$i$双靴子能够承受的最大积雪深度。第$i+2$行的第二个数为$d_i$，表示第$i$双靴子的最大步长。输入保证$0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$以及$1 \leq d_i \leq N-1$。
输出格式（文件名：snowboots.out）：
输出包含$N$行。第$i$行包含一个整数：如果Farmer John能够穿着第$i$双靴子从$1$号地砖走到$N$号地砖，为$1$，否则为$0$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It's winter on the farm, and that means snow! There are $N$ tiles on the path from the farmhouse to the barn, conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, and tile $i$ is covered in $f_i$ feet of snow.
In his farmhouse cellar, Farmer John has $B$ pairs of boots, numbered $1 \dots B$. Some pairs are more heavy-duty than others, and some pairs are more agile than others. In particular, pair $i$ lets FJ step in snow at most $s_i$ feet deep, and lets FJ move at most $d_i$ forward in each step.
Farmer John starts off on tile $1$ and must reach tile $N$ to wake up the cows. Tile $1$ is sheltered by the farmhouse roof, and tile $N$ is sheltered by the barn roof, so neither of these tiles has any snow. Help Farmer John determine which pairs of snow boots will allow him to make the trek.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $B$ ($1 \leq N,B \leq 10^5$).
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers; the $i$th integer is $f_i$, the depth of snow on tile $i$ ($0 \leq f_i \leq 10^9$). It's guaranteed that $f_1 = f_N = 0$.
The next $B$ lines contain two space-separated integers each. The first integer on line $i+2$ is $s_i$, the maximum depth of snow in which pair $i$ can step. The second integer on line $i+2$ is $d_i$, the maximum step size for pair $i$. It's guaranteed that $0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq d_i \leq N-1$.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should consist of $B$ lines. Line $i$ should contain a single integer: $1$ if Farmer John can trek from tile $1$ to tile $N$ wearing the $i$th pair of boots, and $0$ otherwise.</div>
