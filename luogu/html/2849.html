<div>【题目描述】
由于对他的奶牛的健康状况不佳而感到不满，牧场主约翰让它们参加各种各样的体育健身活动。最让他感到自豪的奶牛是Bessie，她将参加约翰牧场附近城市里的马拉松比赛！
马拉松比赛有N个检查点（3≤N≤500）,需要按顺序访问。检查点1是起点，检查点N是终点。Bessie应该按顺序一一访问所有的这些检查点，但由于她是一头懒惰的牛（懒惰竟然还选择跑马拉松！），于是她决定跳过K(K<N)个检查点以缩小她的赛程。但她不能跳过第1个和第N个检查点，因为这样太明显了。 请你帮助Bessie计算出跳过中间的K个检查点后她最少要跑多少距离。 注意：由于街道是网格状的，我们用坐标来表示点的位置。但是（x1,y1）,（x2,y2）两点间的距离应为|x1-x2|+|y1-y2|，这种测量距离的方法被称为“曼哈顿”距离，这是因为在市中心的网格路中，你可以沿平行于x轴或y轴的方向走，但不能沿直线到达。 【输入格式】 第一行L两个正整数N和K。 第2行到第N+1行，每行两个整数x，y（-1000≤x≤1000,-1000≤y≤1000）。 这里给出了检查点的顺序，她必须按顺序访问。注意：可能会有几个检查点出现在同一位置，Bessie跳过这样的检查点时，相当于只跳过其中的一个检查点。 【输出格式】 输出跳过某一个检查点后Bessie可以跑的最短距离。 【输入样例】 5 2 0 0 8 3 1 1 10 -5 2 2 【输出样例】 4 感谢@彭骐飞 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Unhappy with the poor health of his cows, Farmer John enrolls them in an assortment of different physical fitness activities. His prize cow Bessie is enrolled in a running class, where she is eventually expected to run a marathon through the downtown area of the city near Farmer John's farm!
The marathon course consists of N checkpoints (3 <= N <= 500) to be visited in sequence, where checkpoint 1 is the starting location and checkpoint N is the finish. Bessie is supposed to visit all of these checkpoints one by one, but being the lazy cow she is, she decides that she will skip up to K checkpoints (K < N) in order to shorten her total journey. She cannot skip checkpoints 1 or N, however, since that would be too noticeable.
Please help Bessie find the minimum distance that she has to run if she can skip up to K checkpoints.
Since the course is set in a downtown area with a grid of streets, the distance between two checkpoints at locations (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.
Bessie参加城市马拉松比赛，要顺序经过N (3 <= N <= 500)个检查点，其中检查点1是起点，检查点N是终点。 Bessie尝试略过K(K < N)个检查点，以减少总路程，检查点1和检查点N不能被略过。两个检查点的距离是|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|。

</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line gives the values of N and K.
The next N lines each contain two space-separated integers, x and y,representing a checkpoint (-1000 <= x <= 1000, -1000 <= y <= 1000).
The checkpoints are given in the order that they must be visited.
Note that the course might cross over itself several times, with several checkpoints occurring at the same physical location. When Bessie skips such a checkpoint, she only skips one instance of the checkpoint -- she does not skip every checkpoint occurring at the same location.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the minimum distance that Bessie can run by skipping up to K checkpoints. In the sample case shown here, skipping the checkpoints at (8, 3) and (10, -5) leads to the minimum total distance of 4.
