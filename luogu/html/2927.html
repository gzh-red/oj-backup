<h1>[USACO08DEC]拼图游戏Jigsaw Puzzles</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The cows have taken up alphabetical jigsaw puzzles. In these puzzles with R (1 <= R <= 10) rows and C (1 <= C <= 10) columns, the edges are not funny-shaped cardboard shapes but rather are letters.
Each piece has a serial number and 4 letters (or borders) that must be aligned as in a regular jigsaw puzzle. The pseudo-letter '0' (the digit 0) will represent a border (and a piece can have several borders if it is a corner piece or even the top of column in a, e.g., 4x1 puzzle). Below is a set of six pieces (the borders are marked with lines instead of '0's) assembled in one way (of many) that completes the puzzle:
+---+ +---+ +---+
| 1 c c 3 d d 5 |
+-d-+ + a + +-e-+
+-d-+ +-a-+ +-e-+
| 2 b b 4 b b 6 |
+---+ +---+ +---+
Note that each edge letter of each piece matches the border letter of the piece adjacent to it; the borders appear properly on the top, bottom, and sides.
Pieces are represented by a serial number and a clockwise list of their four edges (where edges are the letters a..z and 0). Pieces might require rotation when placed in the puzzle.
Given a set of pieces, find at least one way to assemble them into a puzzle. Test data for puzzles with larger R and C are easier to solve because they have a more varied set of edge letters.
奶牛们在玩按字母表顺序排列的拼图谜题.每道谜题有R(1≤R≤10)列C(1≤C≤10)行的拼图块,它们边缘是由字母或封闭边界组成,完成后的整副拼图外围是边界线,中间的边界是字母.
每块拼图块都有一个序列号和4个字母或者数字表示边界线(顺序为上右下左),在输入中,数字充当边界线.
拼图可以换位和旋转,完成后的拼图在边缘的块上靠近外围的是边界线,拼图完成后,一块拼图若与另一块相邻,它们的边界字母必须相同,以下是一系列已经成功完成的拼图谜题共6块.
