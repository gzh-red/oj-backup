<h1>[POI2013]LAN-Colorful Chain</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Bytie loves to play with colorful chains.
He already has quite an impressive collection, and some of them he likes more than the others.
Each chain consists of a certain number of colorful links.
Byteasar has noticed that Bytie's sense of aesthetics is very precise.
It turns out that Bytie finds a contiguous fragment of a chain nice if it contains exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.1.png) links of color ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.2.png) links of color ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.3.png) links of color ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.4.png), and moreover it contains no links of other colors.
A chain's appeal is its number of (contiguous) fragments that are nice.
By trial and error, Byteasar has determined the values ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.5.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.6.png).
Now he would like to buy a new chain, and therefore asks you to write a program to aid him in shopping.
给定一个序列,求有多少个子序列使得c\_i这个数在这个序列中出现了l\_i次,且不存在其它的数。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the standard input gives two integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.7.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.8.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.9.png)), separated by a single space.
These are the length of the chain and the length of a nice fragment's description.
The second line gives ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.10.png) integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.11.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.12.png)), separated by single spaces.
The third line gives ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.13.png) integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.14.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.15.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.16.png) for ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.17.png)), also separated by single spaces.
The sequences ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.18.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.19.png) define a nice fragment of a chain - it has to contain exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.20.png) links of color ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.21.png).
The fourth line gives ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.22.png) integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.23.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.24.png)), separated by single spaces, that are the colors of successive links of the chain.
In tests worth 50% of total points the constraint ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/lan-en-tex.25.png) holds in addition.
