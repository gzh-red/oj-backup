<h1>[USACO14MAR]懒惰的牛The Lazy Cow_Sliver</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It's a hot summer day, and Bessie the cow is feeling quite lazy. She wants
to locate herself at a position in her field so that she can reach as much
delicious grass as possible within only a short distance.
The field Bessie inhabits is described by an N by N grid of square cells
(1 <= N <= 400). The cell in row r and column c (1 <= r,c <= N) contains
G(r,c) units of grass (0 <= G(r,c) <= 1000). From her initial square in
the grid, Bessie is only willing to take up to K steps (0 <= K <= 2\*N).
Each step she takes moves her to a cell that is directly north, south,
east, or west of her current location.
For example, suppose the grid is as follows, where (B) describes Bessie's
```cpp
50 5 25* 6 17
14 3* 2* 7* 21
99* 10* 1*(B) 2* 80*
8 7* 5* 23* 11
10 0 78* 1 9
```
initial position (here, in row 3, column 3):
If K=2, then Bessie can only reach the locations marked with \*s.
Please help Bessie determine the maximum amount of grass she can reach, if
she chooses the best possible initial location in the grid.
奶牛贝西非常懒惰，她希望在她的地盘内找到一点最佳位置居住，以便在有限的步数内可以吃到尽量多的青草。
她的地盘是一个N行N列(1 <= N <= 400)的矩阵，第r行c列包含G(r,c)单位的青草(0 <= G(r,c) <= 1000)。从她的居住点，她最多愿意走K步(0 <= K <= 2\*N)，每一步她可以找到上、下、左、右直接相邻的某个格子。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: The integers N and K.
\* Lines 2..1+N: Line r+1 contains N integers describing row r of the
grid.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: The maximum amount of grass Bessie can reach, if she chooses
the best possible initial location (the location from which
she can reach the most grass).
</div>

<pre><code>342</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>OUTPUT DETAILS:
In the example above, Bessie can reach 342 total units of grass if she
locates herself in the middle of the grid.
