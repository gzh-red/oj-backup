<h1>[USACO17DEC]My Cow Ate My Homework</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In your bovine history class, you have been given a rather long homework assignment with $N$ questions ($3 \leq N \leq 100,000$), each graded with an integer score in the range 0...10,000. As is often customary, your teacher plans to assign a final grade by discarding a question on which you received the lowest score and then averaging the remaining scores together. Unfortunately, your pet cow Bessie has just eaten your answers to the first $K$ questions! ($K$ could be as small as 1 or as large as $N-2$).
After copious explanation, your teacher finally believes your story, and agrees to grade the remaining non-eaten part of the assignment the same way as before -- by removing the lowest-scoring question (or one such question, in the event of a tie) and averaging the rest.
Please output all values of $K$ which would have earned you the maximum possible score according to this grading scheme, in sorted order.
在你的历史课上，你得到了一个很长的作业。这个作业包含了N个题目（3 ≤ N ≤ 100,000），每个题目的成绩在0~10,000之间。
按照惯例，你的老师按照以下方式计算最终成绩：去掉你最低的一个成绩，然后将其余成绩的平均成绩作为最终成绩。但不幸的是，你的宠物牛“贝西”刚刚吃了前K个题目的答案！（1 ≤ K ≤ N-2）
经过你的一番解释，老师终于相信了你的故事，并且同意对你有答案的题目（没有被吃掉答案的题目）像之前一样给分——通过去掉最低的成绩（如果有多个最低成绩，则只去掉其中一个）并取剩余成绩的平均成绩。
根据这一成绩计算方案，请按升序输出所有可以使你最终成绩最高的K的值。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains $N$, and the next line contains the scores on the $N$ homework questions.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Please output, one value per line, all values of $K$ which would have earned you the maximum possible score.
</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
3 1 9 2 7</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>If Bessie eats the first two questions, then the remaining scores are 9, 2, and 7. Removing the minimum and averaging, we get a final grade of 8, which is the highest possible.
