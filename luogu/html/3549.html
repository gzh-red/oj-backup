<h1>[POI2013]MUL-Multidrink</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Byteasar lives in Byteburg, a city famous for its milk bars on every corner.
One day Byteasar came up with an idea of a "milk multidrink": he wants to visit each milk bar for a drink exactly once.
Ideally, Byteasar would like to come up with a route such that the next bar is always no further than two blocks (precisely: intersections) away from the previous one.
The intersections in Byteburg are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.2.png), and all the streets are bidirectional.
Between each pair of intersections there is a unique direct route, ie, one that does not visit any intersection twice.
Byteasar begins at the intersection no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.3.png) and finishes at the intersection no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.4.png).
Your task is to find any route that satisfies Byteasar's requirements if such a route exists.
An exemplary route satisfying the requirements is: ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.5.png) There is no route that satisfies the requirements.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.6.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.7.png)), denoting the number of intersections in Byteburg.
Each of the following ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.8.png) lines holds a pair of distinct integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.9.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.10.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.11.png)), separated by a single space, that represent the street linking the intersections no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.12.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.13.png).
In tests worth ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.14.png) of all points the condition ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.15.png) holds.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If there is no route satisfying Byteasar's requirements, your program should print a single word "BRAK" (Polish for none), without the quotation marks to the standard output. Otherwise, your program should print ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.16.png) lines to the standard output, the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.17.png)-th of which should contain the number of the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.18.png)-th intersection on an arbitrary route satisfying Byteasar's requirements. Obviously, in that case the first line should hold the number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.19.png), and the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.20.png)-th line - number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.21.png).
