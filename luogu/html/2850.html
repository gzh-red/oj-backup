<h1>[USACO06DEC]虫洞Wormholes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>While exploring his many farms, Farmer John has discovered a number of amazing wormholes. A wormhole is very peculiar because it is a one-way path that delivers you to its destination at a time that is BEFORE you entered the wormhole! Each of FJ's farms comprises N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500) fields conveniently numbered 1..N, M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2500) paths, and W (1 ≤ W ≤ 200) wormholes.
As FJ is an avid time-traveling fan, he wants to do the following: start at some field, travel through some paths and wormholes, and return to the starting field a time before his initial departure. Perhaps he will be able to meet himself :) .
To help FJ find out whether this is possible or not, he will supply you with complete maps to F (1 ≤ F ≤ 5) of his farms. No paths will take longer than 10,000 seconds to travel and no wormhole can bring FJ back in time by more than 10,000 seconds.
John在他的农场中闲逛时发现了许多虫洞。虫洞可以看作一条十分奇特的有向边，并可以使你返回到过去的一个时刻（相对你进入虫洞之前）。John的每个农场有M条小路（无向边)连接着N （从1..N标号）块地，并有W个虫洞。其中1<=N<=500,1<=M<=2500,1<=W<=200。 现在John想借助这些虫洞来回到过去（出发时刻之前），请你告诉他能办到吗。 John将向你提供F(1<=F<=5)个农场的地图。没有小路会耗费你超过10000秒的时间，当然也没有虫洞回帮你回到超过10000秒以前。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Line 1: A single integer, F. F farm descriptions follow.
Line 1 of each farm: Three space-separated integers respectively: N, M, and W
Lines 2..M+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E, T) that describe, respectively: a bidirectional path between S and E that requires T seconds to traverse. Two fields might be connected by more than one path.
Lines M+2..M+W+1 of each farm: Three space-separated numbers (S, E, T) that describe, respectively: A one way path from S to E that also moves the traveler back T seconds.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Lines 1..F: For each farm, output "YES" if FJ can achieve his goal, otherwise output "NO" (do not include the quotes).
</div>

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>For farm 1, FJ cannot travel back in time.
For farm 2, FJ could travel back in time by the cycle 1->2->3->1, arriving back at his starting location 1 second before he leaves. He could start from anywhere on the cycle to accomplish this.
