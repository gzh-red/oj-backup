<h1>[USACO13NOV]农民约翰没有大棕牛Farmer John has no Large Brown Cow</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John likes to collect as many different types of cows as possible. In fact, he has collected almost every conceivable type of cow, except for a few, written on a short list of N lines (1 <= N <= 100). The list looks like this:
Farmer John has no large brown noisy cow.
Farmer John has no small white silent cow.
Farmer John has no large spotted noisy cow.
Each item in the list describes a missing cow in terms of a short list of adjectives, and each item contains the same number of adjectives (3, in this case). The number of adjectives per line will be in the range 2..30.
Farmer John has a cow fitting every other possible adjective combination not on his list. In this example, the first adjective can be large or small, the second can be brown, white, or spotted, and the third can be noisy or silent. This gives 2 x 3 x 2 = 12 different combinations, and Farmer John has a cow fitting each one, except for those specifically mentioned on his list. In this example, a large, white, noisy cow is one of his 9 cows. Farmer John is certain that he has at most 1,000,000,000 cows.
If Farmer John lists his cows in alphabetical order, what is the Kth cow in this list?
Partial credit opportunities: In the 10 test cases for this problem, cases 1..4 involve at most two adjectives per line in Farmer John's list. In cases 1..6, each adjective will have exactly two possible settings (in all other cases, each adjective will have between 1 and N possible settings).
FJ喜欢收集不同的奶牛，他将未有的N(1 <= N <= 100)头奶牛用如下的形式描述：
Farmer John has no large brown noisy cow.
Farmer John has no small white silent cow.
Farmer John has no large spotted noisy cow.
每一行，描述一头FJ未有的牛。
每一行都含有相同个数的形容词，每行的形容词个数范围为2..30。
在以上给出的列表中，每行共有3个形容词，第一个形容词有两种（large和small），第二个形容词有3种（brown,white和spotted），第三个形容词有2种（noisy和silent）。
所以共可以组成12头不同的奶牛，除了列表给出的3头，他已经拥有了其他9头。FJ最多有1,000,000,000头牛。
若将FJ已经拥有的牛按形容词的字典序排序，请问他已有的第K头牛是哪一头。
