<h1>[CERC2015]Hovering Hornet </h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你设法把一只大黄蜂夹在一个放在餐桌顶部的盒子里。不幸的是，你的游戏骰子也被困在里面——你不能取回它，继续你的垄断游戏而不冒着大黄蜂愤怒的风险。取而代之的是，你可以计算出黄蜂看到的骰子上的点数。
大黄蜂、骰子和盒子位于标准的三维坐标系中，x坐标向东生长，y坐标向北生长，z坐标向上生长。该表的表面对应于X-Y平面。骰子是一个1×1×1立方体，放在桌子上，底边的中心正好在原点。因此，它的两个相对的坐标的坐标是（0.5，0.5，0）和（0.5，0.5，1）。骰子的顶面有5个点，南面1个点，东面3个点，北面6个点，西面4个点，底面2个点。
盒子是一个5×5×5立方体，也放在桌子上，里面有骰子。盒子的底部是一个5×5平方的坐标。
假设大黄蜂在不被骰子占据的盒子内的（连续）空间中徘徊于均匀的随机点。计算黄蜂可见的斑点的预期数量。骰子是不透明的，因此，只有当连接点中心和大黄蜂位置的段不与骰子内部相交时，大黄蜂才能看到一个点。输入由4行组成。第k行包含两个πoz点数xk和yk（5±xk，yk为5）-x- y平面中盒底侧第k个角的坐标。坐标是以逆时针方向给出的，它们描述了一个正方形长度为5的正方形。
盒子里装满了骰子。盒子和骰子的表面除了底部之外不交叉或接触。输出一个单一的浮点数 预期的可见光点数。如果判断值的绝对值或相对差值小于10 ^ ^ { 6 }，则该解将被接受。 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have managed to trap a hornet inside a box lying on the top of your dining table. Unfortunately, your playing dice is also trapped inside – you cannot retrieve it and continue your game of Monopoly without risking the hornet’s wrath. Instead, you pass your time calculating the expected number of spots on the dice visible to the hornet.
The hornet, the dice and the box are located in the standard three-dimensional coordinate system with the x coordinate growing eastwards, the y coordinate growing northwards and the z coordinate growing upwards. The surface of the table corresponds to the x-y plane.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/pic/16240.png )
The dice is a 1×1×1 cube, resting on the table with the center of the bottom side exactly in the origin. Hence,the coordinates of its two opposite cornersare (−0.5, −0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0.5, 1). The top side of the dice has 5 spots, the south side 1 spot, the east side 3 spots, the north side 6 spots, the west side 4 spots and the (invisible and irrelevant) bottom side 2 spots.
The box is a 5×5×5 cube also resting on the table with the dice in its interior. The box is speciﬁed by giving the coordinates of its bottom side – a 5×5 square.
Assume the hornet is hovering at a uniformly random point in the (continuous) space inside the box not occupied by the dice. Calculate the expected number of spots visible by the hornet. The dice is opaque and, hence, the hornet sees a spot only if the segment connecting the center of the spot and the location of the hornet does not intersect the interior of the dice.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of 4 lines. The k-th line contains two ﬂoating-point numbers xk and yk (−5≤ xk, yk ≤5) –coordinates of the k-th corner of the bottom side of the box in the x-y plane. The coordinates are given in the counterclockwise direction and they describe a square with the side length of exactly 5.
The box fully contains the dice. The surfaces of the box and the dice do not intersect or touch except along the bottom sides.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single ﬂoating point number – the expected number of spots visible. The solution will be accepted if the absolute or the relative difference from the judges solution is less than $10^{−6}$.</div>
