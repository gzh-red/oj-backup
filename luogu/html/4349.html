<h1>[CERC2015]Digit Division</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个N位的数字，将其分割，保证每个区间里的数字可以被M整除
第一行输入N M
第二行输入待划分的数字
输出有多少种方法，对10^9+7取余
Translated by @chen_zhe</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We are given a sequence of n decimal digits. The sequence needs to be partitioned into one or more contiguous subsequences such that each subsequence, when interpreted as a decimal number, is divisible by a given integer m.
Find the number of different such partitions modulo $10^9 +7$. When determining if two partitions are different, we only consider the locations of subsequence boundaries rather than the digits themselves, e.g. partitions $2|22$ and $22|2$ are considered different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The ﬁrst line contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤300000, 1≤m≤1000000) – the length of the sequence and the divisor respectively. The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n digits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer – the number of different partitions modulo 109 +7.</div>
