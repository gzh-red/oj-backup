<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>To help capture criminals on the run, the police are introducing a new computer system. The area covered by the police contains N cities and E bidirectional roads connecting them. The cities are labelled 1 to N.
为了帮助抓捕逃犯，警方引进了一套新的电脑系统。警察的辖区包含N座城市和E条双向道路，城市的编号是1~N。
The police often want to catch criminals trying to get from one city to another. Inspectors, looking at a map, try to determine where to set up barricades and roadblocks. The new computer system should answer the following two types of queries:
警察常常要抓住那些逃往另一个城市的罪犯。侦查员看着地图，试着确定在哪里设置路障。新的计算机系统要回答以下两种问题：
1. Consider two cities A and B, and a road connecting cities G1 and G2. Can the criminals get
from city A to city B if that one road is blocked and the criminals can't use it?
1.考虑城市$A$和$B$，以及连接城市$G_1$和$G_2$的道路。罪犯能否在那条路不通的情况下从$A$到逃到$B$？
2. Consider three cities A, B and C. Can the criminals get from city A to city B if the entire city
C is cut off and the criminals can't enter that city?
2.考虑三个城市$A$、$B$、$C$。罪犯能否在$C$被切断的情况下从$A$逃到$B$?
Write a program that implements the described system.
写一个程序实现上述系统。

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers N and E (2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ E ≤ 500 000), the number of cities and roads.
Each of the following E lines contains two distinct integers between 1 and N – the labels of two cities connected by a road. There will be at most one road between any pair of cities.
The following line contains the integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 300 000), the number of queries the system is being tested on.
Each of the following Q lines contains either four or five integers. The first of these integers is the type of the query – 1 or 2.
If the query is of type 1, then the same line contains four more integers A, B, G1 and G2 as described earlier. A and B will be different. G1 and G2 will represent an existing road.
If the query is of type 2, then the same line contains three more integers A, B and C. A, B and C will be distinct integers.
The test data will be such that it is initially possible to get from each city to every other city.
