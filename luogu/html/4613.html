<h1>[COCI2017-2018#5] Olivander</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Harry Potter has damaged his magic wand in a fight with Lord Voldemort. He has decided to
get a new wand in Olivander's wand shop. On the floor of the shop, he saw ​N wands and ​N
wand boxes. The lengths of the wands are, respectively, $X_1$
,$X_2$
...​$X_n$
, and the box sizes are
$Y_1$
,​$Y_2$
...$Y_n$
. A wand of length ​X can be placed in a box of size ​Y if ​X ≤ ​Y
. Harry wants to know
if he can place all the wands in boxes so that each box contains exactly one wand.
Help him solve this difficult problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the positive integer ​N
(1 ≤ ​N
≤ 100), the number from the task.
The second line contains ​N
positive integers ​$X_i$
(1 ≤ ​$X_i$
≤ $10^9$​ ), the numbers from the task.
The third line contains ​N
positive integers ​$X_i$
(1 ≤ $X_i$
≤ $10^9$​​ ), the numbers from the task.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If Harry can place all the wands in boxes, output “DA” (Croatian for yes), otherwise output
“NE” (Croatian for no).</div>

<h2>说明</h2>
<div>In test cases worth 60% of total points, it will hold ​N
≤ 9.
**Clarification of the first test case:**
Harry can place the wands in boxes. For example, he can place the wand of length 5 in a box of size
6, wand of length 7 in a box of size 13, and wand of length 9 in a box of size 10.
**Clarification of the second test case:**
Harry can’t place the wands in boxes because the box of size 2 can’t fit any of the wands.</div>
