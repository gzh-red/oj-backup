<h1>[POI2009]KON-Ticket Inspector</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Byteasar works as a ticket inspector in a Byteotian National Railways (BNR) express train that connects Byteburg with Bitwise.\n\nThe third stage of the BNR reform (The never ending saga of BNR reforms and the Bitwise hub was presented in the problems Railway from the third stage of XIV Polish OI and Station from the third stage of XV Polish OI. Their knowledge, however, is not required at all in order to solve this problem.) has begun. In particular, the salaries system has already been changed.\n\nFor example, to encourage Byteasar and other ticket inspectors to efficient work, their salaries now depend on the number of tickets (passengers) they inspect. Byteasar is able to control all the passengers on the train in the time between two successive stations, but he is not eager to waste his energy in doing so. Eventually he decided he would check the tickets exactly ![](//static.oiinhand.info/e8b9244e-111d-4c70-b92c-27c7eb2ad3ea) times per ride.\n\nBefore setting out, Byteasar is given a detailed summary from which he knows exactly how many passengers will travel from each station to another. Based on that he would like to choose the moments of control in such a way that the number of passengers checked is maximal. Obviously, Byteasar is not paid extra for checking someone multiple times - that would be pointless, and would only disturb the passengers. Write a programme that will determine for Byteasar when he should check the tickets in order to maximise his revenue.
有n个车站，现在有一辆火车从1到n驶过，给出aij代表从i站上车j站下车的人的个数。列车行驶过程中你有K次检票 机会，所有当前在车上的人会被检票，问最多能检多少个不同的人的票</div>

The stations are numbered from ![](//static.oiinhand.info/7b3ac15c-c1b8-4712-8055-4e99c6294ede) to ![](//static.oiinhand.info/3c868316-1470-46ed-8e52-7c71cc795374) in the order of appearance on the route.\n\nIn the next ![](//static.oiinhand.info/4f2ef4f0-57f3-439e-a84a-d30841760f27) lines the summary on passengers is given. The ![](//static.oiinhand.info/c8c792f9-621d-42bc-bf2c-cb583d15ef55)-th line contains information on the passengers who enter the train on the station ![](//static.oiinhand.info/06e81d72-9c08-4b8d-8e81-397e135f43a8) - it is a sequence of</div>
