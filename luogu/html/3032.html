<h1>[USACO11NOV]二进制数独Binary Sudoku</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John's cows like to play an interesting variant of the popular game of "Sudoku". Their version involves a 9 x 9 grid of 3 x 3 subgrids, just like regular Sudoku. The cows' version, however, uses only binary digits:
000 000 000
001 000 100
000 000 000
000 110 000
000 111 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
The goal of binary Sudoku is to toggle as few bits as possible so that each of the nine rows, each of the nine columns, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids has even parity (i.e., contains an even number of 1s). For the example above, a set of 3 toggles gives a valid solution:
000 000 000
001 000 100
001 000 100
000 110 000
000 110 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
000 000 000
Given the initial state of a binary Sudoku board, please help the cows determine the minimum number of toggles required to solve it.
给出一个9\*9的01矩阵，问最少修改几个数能使每行、每列以及每个九宫格中1的个数均为偶数。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Lines 1..9: Each line contains a 9-digit binary string corresponding to one row of the initial game board.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: The minimum number of toggles required to make every row, column, and subgrid have even parity.
</div>
