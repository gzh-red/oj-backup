<h1>[CERC2015]Kernel Knights </h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>骑术是一项中世纪的比赛，人们骑在马背上，在高速骑行时，试图用木制长矛互相攻击。总共有2n个骑士参加了一个激战锦标赛——来自两个主要竞争对手的N个骑士。到达后，每一个骑士都从另一个房间挑战一个骑士进行决斗。
内核被定义为骑士的一些子集，具有以下两个属性：
•S中没有骑士受到S中另一个骑士的挑战。
每一个不在S中的骑士都会受到一些S中的骑士的挑战。
考虑到所面临的一系列挑战，确定一个内核。可以保证内核始终存在。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jousting is a medieval contest that involves people on horseback trying to strike each other with wooden lances while riding at high speed. A total of 2n knights have entered a jousting tournament – n knights from each of the two great rival houses. Upon arrival, each knight has challenged a single knight from the other house to a duel.
A kernel is deﬁned as some subset S of knights with the following two properties:
• No knight in S was challenged by another knight in S.
• Every knight not in S was challenged by some knight in S.
Given the set of the challenges issued, ﬁnd one kernel. It is guaranteed that a kernel always exists.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The ﬁrst line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) – the number of knights of each house. The knights from the ﬁrst house are denoted with integers 1 through n, knights from the second house with integers n+1 through 2n.
The following line contains integers $f_1$, $f_2$,..., $f_n$ – the k-th integer fk is the index of the knight challenged by knight k $(n+1≤ f_k ≤2n)$.
The following line contains integers $s_1$,$s_2$,...,$s_n$ – the k-th integer sk is the index of the knight challenged by knight n+k $(1≤s_k ≤n)$. </div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the indices of the knights in the kernel on a single line. If there is more than one solution, you may output any one.
SPJ的格式校验较为严格，请在每个数字后面都输出一个空格，且在最后一个空格输出后请不要输出任何符号。</div>
