<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>“彼得·潘框架”是一种装饰文字，每一个字母都是由一个菱形框架。一个彼得·潘框架看起来像这样 （x是字母，#是框架）：
```
..#..
.#.#.
#.X.#
.#.#.
..#..
```
然而，只是一个框架会有些沉闷，所以我们每遇到三个字母会把第三个字母用温迪框架把它框起来。温迪框架看起来像这样：
```
..*..
.*.*.
*.X.*
.*.*.
..*..
```
当温迪和彼得·潘的框架重叠时，温迪框架覆盖在上面。 （见样例3和4）
输入格式： 一行包含至多15个英文字母的大写字母。
输出格式： 输出使用彼得·潘和温迪框架写成的5行文字。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>“Peter Pan frames” are a way of decorating text in which every character is framed by a diamond shaped frame, with frames of neigbhouring characters interleaving. A Peter Pan frame for one letter looks like this ('X' is the letter we are framing):
```
..#..
.#.#.
#.X.#
.#.#.
..#..
```
However, such a framing would be somewhat dull so we'll frame every third letter using a “Wendyframe”. A Wendy frame looks like this:
```
..*..
.*.*.
*.X.*
.*.*.
..*..
```
When a Wendy frame interleaves with a Peter Pan frame, the Wendy frame (being much nicer) is put on top. For an example of the interleaving check the sample cases.</div>
