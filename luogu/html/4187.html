<h1>[USACO18JAN]Stamp Painting</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Bessie想拿$M$ 种颜色的长为$K$ 的图章涂一个长为$N$ 的迷之画布。假设他选择涂一段区间，则这段区间长度必须为$K$ ，且涂完后该区间颜色全变成图章颜色。他可以随便涂，但是最后必须把画布画满。问能有多少种最终状态，$N\leq 10^6,M\leq 10^6,K\leq 10^6$
对于$75\%$ 的数据，$N,K\leq 10^3$
输入输出格式
输入格式：
一行3个整数$N,M,K$
输出格式：
一个整数表示答案（模$10^9+7$ ）
输入输出样例
说明
如果两个图章叫A,B，合法方案如下:AAB,ABB,BAA,BBA,AAA,BBB

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie has found herself in possession of an $N$-unit long strip of canvas ($1 \leq N \leq 10^6$), and she intends to paint it. However, she has been unable to acquire paint brushes. In their place she has $M$ rubber stamps of different colors ($1 \leq M \leq 10^6$), each stamp $K$ units wide ($1 \leq K \leq 10^6$). Astounded by the possibilities that lie before her, she wishes to know exactly how many different paintings she could conceivably create, by stamping her stamps in some order on the canvas.
To use a stamp, it must first be aligned with exactly $K$ neighboring units on the canvas. The stamp cannot extend beyond the ends of the canvas, nor can it cover fractions of units. Once placed, the stamp paints the $K$ covered units with its color. Any given stamp may be used multiple times, once, or even never at all. But by the time Bessie is finished, every unit of canvas must have been painted at least once.
Help Bessie find the number of different paintings that she could paint, modulo $10^9 + 7$. Two paintings that look identical but were painted by different sequences of stamping operations are counted as the same.
For at least 75% of the input cases, $N,K \leq 10^3$.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input has three integers, $N$, $M$, and $K$. It is guaranteed that $K \leq N$.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer: the number of possible paintings, modulo $10^9 + 7$.
</div>
