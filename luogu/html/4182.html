<h1>[USACO18JAN]Lifeguards P</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>农夫约翰为他的牛开了一个游泳池，他认为这能帮助牛们放松而产出更多的牛奶。 为了保证牛的安全。他雇了几个牛作为救生员，每个救生员都有自己的工作时间。游泳池从0秒一直开放到10^9秒，因此每个救生员的工作时间都可以用两个整数来描述。比如从t=4开始到t=7的工作一共有3秒。 但是农夫约翰雇了太多的救生员，以至于他没有足够的钱全部雇用。如果想要保证每个时刻至少一名救生员在场且用的钱最少，最长可以保证多少秒？
感谢@handahao 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John has opened a swimming pool for his cows, figuring it will help them relax and produce more milk.
To ensure safety, he hires $N$ cows as lifeguards, each of which has a shift that covers some contiguous interval of time during the day. For simplicity, the pool is open from time $0$ until time $10^9$ on a daily basis, so each shift can be described by two integers, giving the time at which a cow starts and ends her shift. For example, a lifeguard starting at time $t = 4$ and ending at time $t = 7$ covers three units of time (note that the endpoints are "points" in time).
Unfortunately, Farmer John hired $K$ more lifeguards than he has the funds to support. Given that he must fire exactly $K$ lifeguards, what is the maximum amount of time that can still be covered by the shifts of the remaining lifeguards? An interval of time is covered if at least one lifeguard is present.
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains $N$ and $K$ ($K \leq N \leq 100,000, 1 \leq K \leq 100$). Each of the next $N$ lines describes a lifeguard in terms of two integers in the range $0 \ldots 10^9$, giving the starting and ending point of a lifeguard's shift. All such endpoints are distinct. Shifts of different lifeguards might overlap.
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Please write a single number, giving the maximum amount of time that can still be covered if Farmer John fires $K$ lifeguards.
</div>
