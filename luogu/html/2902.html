<h1>[USACO08MAR]珍珠配对Pearl Pairing</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>At Bessie's recent birthday party, she received N (2 <= N <= 100,000; N%2 == 0) pearls, each painted one of C different colors (1 <= C <= N).
Upon observing that the number of pearls N is always even, her creative juices flowed and she decided to pair the pearls so that each pair of pearls has two different colors.
Knowing that such a set of pairings is always possible for the supplied testcases, help Bessie perform such a pairing. If there are multiple ways of creating a pairing, any solution suffices.
在Bessie最近的生日聚会上，她收到N（2<=N<=100,000; N％2==0）珍珠，每个都涂上C种不同颜色之一（1<=C<=N）。
观察到珍珠N的数量总是均匀的，她的创意来了，决定配对珍珠，使每双珍珠有两种不同的颜色。数据保证存在答案。请帮助Bessie执行这样的配对，如果有多种创建配对的方法，任意输出即可（不过这里没有spj）。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C
\* Lines 2..C + 1: Line i+1 tells the count of pearls with color i: C\_i
行1：两个空格分隔的整数：N和C。
行2…C+1：行i+1为颜色i：C\_i的珍珠数。
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Lines 1..N/2: Line i contains two integers a\_i and b\_i indicating that Bessie can pair two pearls with respective colors a\_i and b\_i.
行1…N/2：行i包含两个整数a\_i和b\_i，表示Bessie可以将两个珍珠与各自的颜色a\_i和b\_i配对。
