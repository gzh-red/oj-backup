<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Byteotian company 0101010 produces toys for children. 0101010 is well known, and their toys areconsidered top quality. To their horror, the employees have noticed that the four most recent modelsof teddies: $A1$, $A2$,$B1$ and $B2$ have a latent defect: should we take three teddies which all have thesame letter in their model designations, or all have the same digit in their model designations, andline them up next to one another, the teddies will suffer an irreparable damage.
We shall say teddies are safely lined up, if none of them will suffer damage due to the latentdefect, i.e. no three consecutive teddies have the same letter in their model designations, nor thesame digit.
Byteasar has a collection of teddies, in which there are only the feral models -he has grown upto play with teddies only just, you see. To make things worse, Byteasar plays with his teddies bylining them up! Fortunately, despite his young age, he is well aware of the danger. Thus he wonders,how many safe line-ups of teddies are possible at all. And that's where the problems start - he isunable to determine it all by himself... Be a good mate and write a programme to help him!
TaskWrite a programme which:
reads from the standard input the numbers of teddies of each type, calculates the number of safe line-ups of the teddies, modulo $1\ 000\ 000$, writes the result to the standard output.
byteotian公司是著名的儿童玩具公司，他们的玩具被认为具有世界顶尖的质量。最近发生了一件另员工们恐慌大事，他们注意到，最近生产的四种型号的泰迪熊：A1，A2，B1，B2有潜在的缺陷：当序列中连续的三个泰迪熊型号的字母（A或B）全部相同，或型号中的数字（1或2）全部相同时，如果这三只熊被放在另一只熊旁边，这些泰迪熊将遭受无法弥补的损失。
我们需要将泰迪熊安全地排列，没有一个泰迪会被这个潜在的缺陷损坏，即没有连续三个泰迪熊在他们的模型中的型号有相同的字母或者数字。
Byteasar只爱收藏重口味的泰迪熊，但糟糕的是，Byteasar与他的泰迪熊排列了起来！幸运的是，尽管他还年轻，他也意识到危险的存在。因此他想知道，有多少种可能的安全的排列方式。因为他的智商依然十分捉急，所以作为他的左膀右臂，你将写一个程序来帮助他!

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only line of the standard input there are four non-negative integers:
$n_{A1}$,$n_{A2}$,$n_{B1}$,$n_{B2}$, separated by single spaces($0\le n_{A1},n_{A2},n_{B1},n_{B2}\le 38$).
They denote the numbers of teddies,of models $A1$, $A2$, $B1$ and $B2$, respectively. The total number of teddies will always be positive.
只有一行输入，这一行有四个非负整数：
nA1,nA2,nA3,nA4他们之间被一个空格分隔。(0≤nA1,nA2,nB1,nB2≤38)
分别代表了四种型号泰迪熊的数量，泰迪熊总数总是正数。
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only line of the standard output your programme should write the number of safeline-ups of teddies, modulo $1\ 000\ 000$.
只有一行输出，输出安全排列所有泰迪熊的方案数。
因为答案可能比较大，所以最后输出答案对1,000,000取模的结果。
