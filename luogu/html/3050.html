<h1>[USACO12MAR]巨大的旗帜Large Banner</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie is returning from a long trip abroad to the Isle of Guernsey, and Farmer John wants to mount a nice "Welcome Home" banner for her arrival. Farmer John's field has integer dimensions M x N (1 <= M, N <= 100,000), and he has installed a post at every possible point in the field with integer coordinates (if we assign a coordinate system to the field so that (0,0) is in the lower-left corner and (M,N) is in the upper-right corner). Of these (M+1) \* (N+1) points, Farmer John must pick two as the endpoints of the banner.
Farmer John, being the perfectionist that he is, insists that the banner must be completely straight. This means that, for the two posts he chooses, there cannot be any other post on the line segment that the banner will form between them. Additionally, Farmer John wants the banner to have length at least L and at most H (1 <= L <= H <= 150,000). Farmer John needs your help to figure out how many possible ways he can hang the banner. The banner is reversible, so switching the two endpoints of the banner counts as the same way to hang the banner. As this number may be very large, Farmer John simply wants to know what it is modulo B (1 <= B <= 1,000,000,000).
Consider the example below, with M = 2 and N = 2:
\* \* \*
\* \* \*
\* \* \*
Farmer John wants the length of the banner to be between 1 and 3 inclusive. Any choice of posts satisfies this length requirement, but note that eight pairs cannot be picked:
(0, 0) and (2, 0): (1, 0) is on the line segment between them
(0, 1) and (2, 1): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them
(0, 2) and (2, 2): (1, 2) is on the line segment between them
(0, 0) and (2, 2): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them
(0, 0) and (0, 2): (0, 1) is on the line segment between them
(1, 0) and (1, 2): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them
(2, 0) and (2, 2): (2, 1) is on the line segment between them
(0, 2) and (2, 0): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them
Therefore, there are a total of (9 choose 2) - 8 = 28 possible locations.
给出n,m,l,h，问有多少点A(ax,ay),B(bx,by)满足：ax,bx∈[0,n], ay,by∈[0,m]，l<=AB<=h，且线段AB上除A,B外无整点。
