<h1>[USACO10OCT]湖计数Lake Counting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Due to recent rains, water has pooled in various places in Farmer John's field, which is represented by a rectangle of N x M (1 <= N <= 100; 1 <= M <= 100) squares. Each square contains either water ('W') or dry land ('.'). Farmer John would like to figure out how many ponds have formed in his field. A pond is a connected set of squares with water in them, where a square is considered adjacent to all eight of its neighbors. Given a diagram of Farmer John's field, determine how many ponds he has.
由于近期的降雨，雨水汇集在农民约翰的田地不同的地方。我们用一个NxM(1<=N<=100;1<=M<=100)网格图表示。每个网格中有水('W') 或是旱地('.')。一个网格与其周围的八个网格相连，而一组相连的网格视为一个水坑。约翰想弄清楚他的田地已经形成了多少水坑。给出约翰田地的示意图，确定当中有多少水坑。
