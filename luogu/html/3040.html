<h1>[USACO12JAN]贝尔分享Bale Share</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John has just received a new shipment of N (1 <= N <= 20) bales of hay, where bale i has size S\_i (1 <= S\_i <= 100). He wants to divide the bales between his three barns as fairly as possible.
After some careful thought, FJ decides that a "fair" division of the hay bales should make the largest share as small as possible. That is, if B\_1, B\_2, and B\_3 are the total sizes of all the bales placed in barns 1, 2, and 3, respectively (where B\_1 >= B\_2 >= B\_3), then FJ wants to make B\_1 as small as possible.
For example, if there are 8 bales in these sizes:
2 4 5 8 9 14 15 20
A fair solution is
```cpp
Barn 1: 2 9 15 B_1 = 26
Barn 2: 4 8 14 B_2 = 26
Barn 3: 5 20 B_3 = 25
Please help FJ determine the value of B_1 for a fair division of the hay bales.
```
FJ有N (1 <= N <= 20)包干草，干草i的重量是 S\_i (1 <= S\_i <= 100)，他想尽可能平均地将干草分给3个农场。
他希望分配后的干草重量最大值尽可能地小，比如， B\_1,B\_2和 B\_3是分配后的三个值，假设B\_1 >= B\_2 >= B\_3，则他希望B\_1的值尽可能地小。
例如：8包干草的重量分别是：2 4 5 8 9 14 15 20，一种满足要求的分配方案是
农场 1: 2 9 15 B\_1 = 26
农场 2: 4 8 14 B\_2 = 26
农场 3: 5 20 B\_3 = 25
请帮助FJ计算B\_1的值。
