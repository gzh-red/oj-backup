<h1>[USACO08NOV]时间管理Time Management</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ever the maturing businessman, Farmer John realizes that he must manage his time effectively. He has N jobs conveniently numbered 1..N (1 <= N <= 1,000) to accomplish (like milking the cows, cleaning the barn, mending the fences, and so on).
To manage his time effectively, he has created a list of the jobs that must be finished. Job i requires a certain amount of time T\_i (1 <= T\_i <= 1,000) to complete and furthermore must be finished by time S\_i (1 <= S\_i <= 1,000,000). Farmer John starts his day at time t=0 and can only work on one job at a time until it is finished.
Even a maturing businessman likes to sleep late; help Farmer John determine the latest he can start working and still finish all the jobs on time.
