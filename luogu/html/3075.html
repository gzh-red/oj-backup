<h1>[USACO13FEB]分区的农场Partitioning the Farm</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John's farm is divided into an N x N square grid of pastures (2 <= N <= 15). Right now, there is a fence around the outside of the farm, but cows can move freely from pasture to pasture.
Farmer John has decided to build fences to separate the cows from each other. Because of zoning laws, each fence must be a horizontal or vertical line going across the entire farm and fences cannot go through pastures. Farmer John only has enough money to build at most K fences (1 <= K <= 2N - 2).
Farmer John wants to build the fences in order to minimize the size of the largest resulting group of cows (two cows are in the same group if they can reach each other without going through any fences). Given the current number of cows in each pasture, help Farmer John compute the size of the largest group of cows if he builds the fences optimally.
给出一个n\*n的矩阵，用k条水平或竖直直线分割矩阵，最小化区域和最大值。
</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: Two integers, N and K
\* Lines 2..1+N: There are N numbers per line, describing the cows in each pasture for one row of the farm (there are at least 0 and at most 1000 cows in each pasture)
</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>\* Line 1: The minimum possible size of the largest group of cows.
</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3 2 
1 1 2 
1 1 2 
2 2 4 
</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4 
</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>Farmer John should build fences between columns 2 and 3 and between rows 2 and 3, which creates 4 groups each with 4 cows.
