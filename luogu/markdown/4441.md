## 题意翻译

Little Mirko圣诞节买了一台电子游戏机。它不是PlayStation 4或Xbox One，而是AtARI 2600，它附带了一个免费游戏。游戏的主角站在屏幕的底部，屏幕的其他部分分散着各种各样的物体，它们朝底部落下。

更确切地说，屏幕可以表示为R行和R列中排列的RXS像素的网格。主角拿起一个像素的最低线，并标记为“M”。其余的像素用一些字符标记：“.”（空格），“*”（炸弹），“（”（开括号）或“）”（闭括号）。

主角可以在一次移动中向左或向右移动一个像素，但不需要，而其余对象同时向下（可能离开屏幕）移动一个像素。当主角发现自己处于与括号之一相同的位置时，我们说他拾起那个括号并将它添加到他获得的括号数组的末尾。主角的目标是获取最长有效的括号表达式。

一个有效的括号表达式是用下面的方式归纳的：

“（）”是一个有效的表达式。

如果一个是有效的表达式，那么“（a）”也是一个有效的表达式。

如果A和B是有效的表达式，那么“ab”也是一个有效的表达式。

游戏结束时，主角发现自己在同一个位置的炸弹，或者当所有的物体从屏幕上掉下来。

## 题目描述

Little Mirko got a video game console for Christmas. It wasn’t a Playstation 4 or an Xbox one, but Atari 2600, and it came with one free game. The protagonist of the game is standing on the bottom of the screen, and there are various objects dispersed on the rest of the screen, falling towards the bottom.

More precisely, the screen can be represented as a grid of RxS pixels arranged in R rows and S columns. The protagonist takes up one pixel of the lowest line and is marked with ‘M’. The rest of the pixels are marked with some of the characters: ‘.’ (empty space), ‘*’ (bomb), ‘(‘ (open bracket) or ‘)’ (closed bracket).

The protagonist can move one pixel to the left or to the right in a single move, but doesn’t need to, whereas the rest of the objects simultaneously move one pixel down (possibly out of the screen). When the protagonist finds himself at the same position as one of the brackets, we say that he picked up that bracket and added it at the end of his array of acquired brackets. The protagonist’s goal is to acquire the longest possible **valid** bracket

expression.

A valid bracket expression is defined inductively in the following way:

- “()” is a valid expression

- If **a​** is a valid expression, then “(**a**​)” is a valid expression as well

- If **a​** and **b​** are valid expressions, then “**ab**​” is a valid expression as well

The game ends when the protagonist finds himself at the same position as the bomb, or when all the objects fall out of the screen.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains the positive integers R ​and S ​(1 ≤ R, S ≤ 300) that represent the dimensions of the screen.

Each of the following R lines contains S characters ‘M’, ‘.’, ‘*’, ‘(‘ or ‘)’ that represent the initial state of the screen.

Test data will be such that there will always exist at least one valid bracket expression that is possible to acquire. 

### 输出格式

In the first line, you must output the length of the longest valid bracket expression that Mirko can acquire.

In the second line, output that expression. If there are multiple longest valid expressions, output the **lexicographically​ ​smallest​** one.

## 说明

In test cases worth 25% of total points, it will hold 1 ≤ R ≤ 15.

In test cases worth 50% of total points, it will hold 1 ≤ R ≤ 100.

If you output the correct length, but the wrong expression, you will be awarded 40% of points for that test case. In any case, in order to score points, your output must consist of two non-empty lines. ~~(但我并不会做spj，所以这话屁用没有)~~

**Clarification​ ​of​ ​the​ ​first​ ​test​ ​case**:​ ​The protagonist’s moves are: left, left, right right.

**Clarification​ ​of​ ​the​ ​second​ ​test​ ​case**:​ ​The protagonist’s moves are: stay still, stay still, stay still, right, left.

**Clarification​ ​of​ ​the​ ​third​ ​test​ ​case**:​ ​The protagonist’s moves are: stay still, stay still, right.
