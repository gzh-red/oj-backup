# [USACO06NOV]糟糕的一天Bad Hair Day

## 题意翻译

农夫约翰有$N (N \leq 80000)$头奶牛正在过乱头发节。每一头牛都站在同一排面朝东方，而且每一头牛的身高为$h_i$。第$N$头牛在最前面，而第$1$头牛在最后面。

对于第$i$头牛前面的第$j$头牛，如果$h_i>h_{i+1}$并且$h_i>h_{i+2}$ $\cdots$ $h_i>h_j$，那么认为第$i$头牛可以看到第$i+1$到第$j$头牛

定义$C_i$为第$i$头牛所能看到的别的牛的头发的数量。请帮助农夫约翰求出$\sum_{i=1}^n C_i$

## 题目描述

Some of Farmer John's N cows (1 ≤ N ≤ 80,000) are having a bad hair day! Since each cow is self-conscious about her messy hairstyle, FJ wants to count the number of other cows that can see the top of other cows' heads.

Each cow i has a specified height hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 1,000,000,000) and is standing in a line of cows all facing east (to the right in our diagrams). Therefore, cow i can see the tops of the heads of cows in front of her (namely cows i+1, i+2, and so on), for as long as these cows are strictly shorter than cow i.

Consider this example:

        =

=       =

=   -   =         Cows facing right -->

=   =   =

= - = = =

= = = = = =

1 2 3 4 5 6 Cow#1 can see the hairstyle of cows #2, 3, 4

Cow#2 can see no cow's hairstyle

Cow#3 can see the hairstyle of cow #4

Cow#4 can see no cow's hairstyle

Cow#5 can see the hairstyle of cow 6

Cow#6 can see no cows at all!

Let ci denote the number of cows whose hairstyle is visible from cow i; please compute the sum of c1 through cN.For this example, the desired is answer 3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5.
