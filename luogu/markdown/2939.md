# [USACO09FEB]改造路Revamping Trails

## 题意翻译

约翰一共有N)个牧场.由M条布满尘埃的小径连接.小径可 以双向通行.每天早上约翰从牧场1出发到牧场N去给奶牛检查身体.

通过每条小径都需要消耗一定的时间.约翰打算升级其中K条小径，使之成为高 速公路.在高速公路上的通行几乎是瞬间完成的，所以高速公路的通行时间为0.

请帮助约翰决定对哪些小径进行升级，使他每天从1号牧场到第N号牧场所花的时间最短

## 题目描述

Farmer John dutifully checks on the cows every day. He traverses some of the M (1 <= M <= 50,000) trails conveniently numbered 1..M from pasture 1 all the way out to pasture N (a journey which is always possible for trail maps given in the test data). The N (1 <= N <= 10,000) pastures conveniently numbered 1..N on Farmer John's farm are currently connected by bidirectional dirt trails. Each trail i connects pastures P1\_i and P2\_i (1 <= P1\_i <= N; 1 <= P2\_i <= N) and requires T\_i (1 <= T\_i <= 1,000,000) units of time to traverse.

He wants to revamp some of the trails on his farm to save time on his long journey. Specifically, he will choose K (1 <= K <= 20) trails to turn into highways, which will effectively reduce the trail's traversal time to 0. Help FJ decide which trails to revamp to minimize the resulting time of getting from pasture 1 to N.

TIME LIMIT: 2 seconds

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

\* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and K

\* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes trail i with three space-separated integers: P1\_i, P2\_i, and T\_i

### 输出格式

\* Line 1: The length of the shortest path after revamping no more than K edges

## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
4 4 1 
1 2 10 
2 4 10 
1 3 1 
3 4 100 

```
### 输出样例 #1

```cpp
1 

```
## 说明

K is 1; revamp trail 3->4 to take time 0 instead of 100. The new shortest path is 1->3->4, total traversal time now 1.
