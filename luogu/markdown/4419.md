## 题意翻译

## 题目大意

牌库中有52张卡牌，每张卡牌有范围在1-11内的数值，除数值为10的卡牌共有16张外，其余每种数值的卡牌各有四张。在游戏中，玩家可以不断抽牌，直到手中所有牌的数值相加的和大于21为止。当手牌的数值的和大于21时，游戏结束。

我们设X为拿到的牌的数值之和与21的差，那么很显然当牌库中数值大于X的牌的数量大于或等于牌库中数值小于或等于X的牌的数量时，游戏结束。

现已知已经抽了N张牌，并且知道每一次抽的牌的数值a[i]（保证a[1]+a[2]+...+a[N]小于等于21），问是否能够继续抽牌。

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式：

第一行包括一个正整数N（1≤N≤52），表示已抽的卡牌数量。

接下来N行中的每一行有一个正整数a[i]表示第i次抽到的卡牌的数值。

### 输出格式：

如果还可以抽牌，输出“VUCI”，否则输出“DOSTA”。

## 说明

对于第一个样例：

已拿的手牌的总数量N为15，X的值为6。牌库中卡牌的值大于6的卡牌数量为32（4张11，16张10，4张9，4张8和4张7，而牌组中值小于或等于6的卡牌数量为14（1张2，1张3，4张4，4张5和4张6）。

## 题目描述

Little Caesar likes card games. Everytime he comes to Zagreb, he plays blackjack, the famous card game, with his friends.

In this game, the player draws cards while the sum of the cards in his hand is less than or equal to 21 or until he says “DOSTA” (Croatian for “STOP”).

At the beginning of the game, there are 52 cards in the deck, thirteen ranks of each of the four suits. The card ranks are two, three, …, ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. The card values are the following: the cards with numbers on them are worth that number (e.g., “nine” is 9), the cards with pictures (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10, whereas the Ace is worth 11.

Caesar has found himself in an interesting situation. During the game, he already drew N cards whose sum is less than or equal to 21 and is now having second thoughts about drawing one more card or not. Let’s assume X is the difference from the sum of the cards so

far to 21. Everybody knows that you don’t draw a card if the number of the remaining cards in the deck whose value is greater than X is greater than or equal to the number of the remaining cards in the deck whose value is less than or equal to X.

Since Caesar is having a difficult time calculating whether he needs to draw another card or not, he’s asking you to do it for him.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains the positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 52), the number of cards Caesar has drawn so far.

Each of the following N lines contains a single positive integer, the value of the $i^{th}$ card Caesar drew.

### 输出格式

If Caesar should draw another card, output “VUCI” (Croatian for “DRAW”), otherwise output “DOSTA” (Croatian for “STOP”).

## 说明

Clarification​ ​of​ ​the​ ​first​ ​test​ ​case:

The sum of the already drawn cards is 15, and the difference X to 21 is 6. The number of cards in the

deck with a value greater than 6 is 32 (4 Aces, 4 Kings, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks, 4 tens, 4 nines, 4 eights, and 4 sevens), whereas the number of cards in the deck with a value less than or equal to 6 is 14 (one two, one three, 4 fours, 4 fives, and 4 sixes).
