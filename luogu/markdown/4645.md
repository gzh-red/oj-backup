## 题意翻译

给定一个有向图，n个点，m条边。请问，1号点到2号点有多少条路径？如果有无限多条，输出inf，如果有限，输出答案模10^9的余数。

两点之间可能有重边，需要看成是不同的路径。

## 题目描述

A bicycle race is being organized in a land far, far away. There are N town in the land, numbered 1 through N. There are also M one-way roads between the towns. The race will start in town 1 and end in town 2.

How many different ways can the route be set? Two routes are considered different if they do not use the exact same roads.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100 000), the number of towns and roads.

Each of the next M lines contains two different integers A and B, representing a road between towns A and B.

Towns may be connected by more than one road.

### 输出格式

Output the number of distinct routes that can be set on a single line. If that number has more than nine digits, output only the last nine digits of the number. If there are infinitely many routes, output "inf".
